## Project Objective(s)

#### Executive Summary
Having been a bit of a scotch lover for a few years now, I have been consistently frustrated in how difficult it is to find new scotches I can try with any resemblance of ease. Before starting this data science immersive course, I would have spent at least 20 to 30 minutes reading and researching through a scotch list trying to find the scotch that was right for me and what I was currently craving. Having finished the program now, I figured why not just make my own? That is exactly what I did!

The Digital Scotch Sommelier (DSS) is my first personal adventure into building a recommender system that is targeted at the kinds of things I want recommendations for.

Through defining your preference of type of scotch, price range per bottle and the alcohol by volume the DSS can filter from a list nearing 2300 different scotches to a much more manageable list sorted by points earned very similar to how wine is graded. If you would like something more specific, the DSS can also take into account 1 to 3 different flavor profiles that it will search through the descriptions of each scotch and find as many as possible matching your exact preference. 

The dropdown menus will include:

Scotch Type:
- Blended Scotch

- Single Grain Scotch 

Price Range:
- Below 50
