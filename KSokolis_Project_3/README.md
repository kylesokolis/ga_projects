# Problem Statement
Through the use of Natural Language Processing, can one accurately using Logistical Regression, Naive Bayes, and a Random Forest model predict a reddit post between a Conspiracy and an Unpopular Opinion subreddit?

Success will be considered if a score of over 80% is achieved since the topics can be considered quite similar.

If these models are successful, they could apply to a multitude of situations where similar topics are being compared.

# Result
Though I believe its due to its naivety, the Naive Bayes performed best on the test data when compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
