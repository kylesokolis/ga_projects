5,are animals even remotely conscious?,"is the evolution of domesticated animals driving them towards consciousness? Or do we just personify the hell out of our dogs and cats by imagining that they can actually communicate with us as a distinct personality?

&amp;#x200B;

I have pets and love animals in general so much, but i can't help but question their consciousness. On one hand I can feel really connected with them, but then I'll still get little moments of ""does this little creature actually love"" or like reptiles and below on the evolutionary tree are so much more absent to me. Do they express emotion at all? So is consciousness something held in genes and, that being so, we could breed consciousness into dogs/cats/whatever? talking, communicating, sentient dogs/cats/whatever

&amp;#x200B;

so the second question is basically could we breed sentient dogs and cats like us?

10,Dolphins vs Lucy the Australopithecus,"I ended up in an argument with a friend today because I was having trouble with a claim she made. Context is important so I will start with that.

I have had 0 formal education and got a D at A level in Biology. I am not stupid and did a bachelors degree in mathematics. My friend is a clinical superviser and works at a methodrone clinic and actually did a dual masters studying anthropology and psychology at university.

Much later after my formal studies and I am loving the concept of evolution and want to understand it as fully as possible. I have read articles and watched youtube videos and feel I have a reasonable grasp of the concept of natural selection and evolution while not fully comprehending some of the high level science.

The claim she made that started the argument was humans have more genetic markers similar to dolphins than Lucy the Austrolopithocus fossil discovered. She said that modern humans didn't evolve directly from Lucy and I found this claim baseless and was trying to express my scepticism on this point. 

My understanding of evolution put simply is that Lucy while even if she may not be directly a decendent of modern humans there will be a common ancester closer to homosapiens than there are homosapiens than dolphins. 

She told me I am wrong blasted my level of education and restated her intelligence and told me that I am misunderstanding on a fundamental level telling me I need to stop watching youtube videos and pick up a text book and stay off the internet and I will realise how wrong I am.

Naturally I didnt listen but out of fairness I am trying to find something to justify her claim and understand how she came to this conclusion. The closest I can find is we are somewhat genetically similar to dolphins in terms of our DNA having similarities but I think she is completely wrong in terms of Lucy. Am I mistaken on this point or is she being a unreasonable? 

I will grant the point I am not by any standard an expert but I think I may actually have a better grasp than her on this particular scientific topic. I am also of the opinion the source of my understanding is irrelevant.",evolution,1542845513,EvoSoldior,9,1,True,2018-11-21

13,Genetic variation in what already works plus a cure for genetic heart defects8.,"I had a thought regarding the phenotype of a heart. If a mutation occurred to one of the active genes responsible for this organ then this can have a few options. The list below may be overly simplified and may also not be exclusively these options.

1. The heart becomes more beneficial to survival.

2. The heart changes slightly but is no more beneficial than before

3. The heart is irreparably altered and cannot function resulting in a potential fatal flaw and the potential embryo doesn't make it to term.

4. The heart is weakened by the change but the organism reaches sexual maturity passes on this defect to its young.

Please clarify if my understanding is flawed and i am completely wrong.

If our technology becomes advanced enough that we can recognise and repair the abnormalities displayed in parts 3 and 4 we could increase the overall genetic health of a species and reduce the chance of a disadvantageous mutation from being spread to other members of the population.

17,Evolution scientists are evil,"To say someone is evil is to express a subjective opinion. 

I form the opinion by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, choosing the word ""evil"". I might have chosen the word ""nice"", that would be an equally logically valid opinion.

The evolution scientists have several courses of action available to them, and according to me, evil is what makes their choices turn out the way they do, instead of another way. 

The existence of evil is therefore a matter of chosen opinion, it is spiritual. I choose the opinion it exists. 

That's how subjectivity works, an opinion is formed with a choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice. 

I look at the choices evolution scientists make, look at the consequences of their choices, look at what other options they had, and then I make an opinion on what the agency of their choices was. 

It's because of evolution scientists that the human spirit is not commonly acknowledged anymore in society. People don't acknowledge each other's emotions anymore because they don't understand how subjectivity works anymore. 

First the evolution scientist describes the entire life of organisms using subjective words, like that an organisms likes to survive, that it has fear, joy and whatever. Then the evolution scientist asserts that this is all factual. The evolution scientists assert subjective words as fact. 

Second the evolution scientist asserts creationism is wrong, while subjective opinion, as explained, is a creationist concept. 

So 1 and 2, it is a double slam against subjectivity. It results in particularly higher educated people having no clue about how subjectivity works, and disregarding people's emotions. Almost 100 percent of scientists accept evolution, so it basically applies to all scientists, not just evolution scientists. 

If I post on the internet about the human spirit it is certain everybody there will require evidence for this spirit thing. Nobody has a clue anymore about how subjectivity works. Certainly society has become a bad joke, where it is held to be virtue to systematically ignore people's emotions, because it is virtue to adhere to the scientific method in all cases.

The schoolbook for the Hitler Youth shows where teaching evolution science ends up. The book starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"", and then it proceeds to claim that the content of character of people is a factual issue of racial science. 

Evolution scientists are evil, evolution theory must be destroyed. 

Actually creationists are guilty too, because it seems I am the only creationist in the entire world teaching about subjectivity. If many creationists taught about subjectivity, then the bad influence of evolution theory would be limited. But for now creationists teach more or less the right structure in regards to God and the human soul, but they do not teach it in detail.

43,I have a PhD in organic chemistry and love science however evolution isnt science and I'm certain no animals evolved.,"No animal or life form ever changes outside of its form of life. Example, no wolf will ever become anything that isn't a wolf/dog etc.

Knowledge of chemistry and thr insane complexity of insanely complicated molecules... Even enzymes, especially proteins and then r a or dna forming by chance and then also reproducing somehow just doesn't work. It can never work.

Just by understanding abiogenesis just can't happen as in life spontaneously happening and organizing itself even by random ""chance"" beneficial mutations or natural selection just cannot make complex molecules. Oxygen is also detrimental to organic molecules.

Even a simple caffeine molecule can not form by chance, please stop saying anything beyond that could form by chance.

Furthermore saying evolution doesn't deal with abiogenesis is a weak arguement and not a defense for evolution. And to say because I don't agree with evolutionary theories means I don't understand evolution is stupid.

I've always been a strong math/chemistry genius and skeptic at heart of everything. Even as a 7th grader while every child quickly believed the status of quo of thinking evolution happened and pleasing society, teachers, other friends, and in general the mainstream world, I always understood evolution isn't science. It can't be repeatedly tested or observed. I've only ever seen evolutionists going on to research with massive confirmation bias already assuming evolution is fact and looking for anything to support the theory and rejecting anything that shows evolution to possibly be wrong.

People who believe in evolution simply like the idea of it. Whether or not it's true isn't something they care for. They only like the idea of it so they believe it or claim it's ""fact"". Simply because many scientists believe it doesn't make it true. Evolution is a flawed science. It's not even science as a matter of fact. It's not even a hypothesis. It's a metaphysical research program. Evolution is always something people need to research. Anything that shows it may be wrong is instantly hidden or rejected.

Never have I seen a field of science so badly praised. Even geocentrists hundreds of years ago weren't as stubborn as evolutionists.

I understand now every evolutionist is ready to come with the standard operating procedure comments with the ""you don't understand evolution"", ""you're not a biologist/geologist/anthropologist"". ""You probably didn't graduate at a good university or bribed or fuked ur way to a degree (I wish I had hot bitches as teachers but never did.. I did fuk my mom's manager though and she paid for herself to get fuked.)

Honestly all I wish is we could have a discussion trying to find evidence against evolution just for fun to see how fun sketicism is even towards evolution.

Just a single or a few comments from men like them speaking against evolution and instantly they get the same dumb comments... ""You dont understand evolution.""

54,Effect of Neutral Mutations on Genome Translation rate,"Hey Guys, 

I ran into [this article](http://evolutiondismantled.com/neutral-mutations) saying that Neutral mutations don't occur because even though genetic code is degenerate, changes in the codon will reduce rate of translation, presumably changing fitness.

&gt;**“Some codons code for the same amino acid. Therefore, a change from one to the other will not produce any change — even to the genotype.”**  
This is a convincing response, but it too fails. Since certain codons (genetic ‘words’ composed of 3 nucleotides or ‘letters’) are less-used than others, the body does not produce as much tRNA for that specific codon[\[6\]](http://evolutiondismantled.com/neutral-mutations#ref6). Therefore, protein synthesis can be slowed. So even a seeming neutral change such as TCC to TCT (both of which produce the amino acid serine) is not completely neutral.

69,Reduction of Evolution and Creation,"Hello all, forgive me if this post belongs elsewhere or has been repeated but I wanted to have an insightful discussion about one of the biggest problems I’ve always had with evolution, namely the Big Bang. 

If we reduce their entire arguments down to the beginning, both creationists and evolutionists agree on one thing: that at one point nothing existed in what we know as our universe. 

Creationists argue that God has always existed outside of time itself, and eventually decided to create everything (or set evolution in motion if you’re a theistic evolutionist)

Evolutionists argue that after there was nothing, a sort of ‘Big Bang’ (for lack of a better term)  occurred, setting in motion the process of evolution. 

So everything else aside, it seems I have to believe either: 

Creationism: an unknown entity existing outside of every rule of reality just decided to create an intricate, delicate system on one minuscule speck of a planet in an infinite universe

Evolution: nothing created everything

Which in turn could fertilize new eggs, read the DNA and produce new gamete cells. Humans are not able to reproduce before they are at least in their teens, and then they have to wait nine months before the baby is born.

So, larger and more complex brains would give the advantage of allowing for more complex thought processes, while the increased amount of required energy would not be a major problem. After all, with cooking, the food supply had dramatically increased overnight.

What that source did not mention was the obvious follow up to this idea. That, with a more complex brain, hunting, gathering, and cooking methods were improved, allowing for an even greater food supply. So, we have a positive feedback: the larger the brain, the larger the food supply. So, the brain can grow even more, unchecked by evolutionary pressures, and the food supply will follow suit.

An obvious weird human behavior is *laughter*.

Laughter makes sense as an adaptation for children at pre-linguistic stages of development to say ""more of this"", as opposed to crying, which signals ""less of this"".

As a group adaptation is sort of makes sense for mitigating conflict and to signal ""this is/I am/we are not a thread"", but group selection is a weak evolutionary signal.

So what is left is *sexual selection*, and it seems laughter and humor make a whole lot of sense in this context. Humor *feels* exactly like a set of antlers or a peacock tail: It is not conductive for raw survival at all, yet incredibly complex. Laughter typically has the connotation of ""hey, look, I'm getting this"". It is about social status, about declaring one's own status or acknowledging someone else's status in terms of the ability to process information. It seems it's often about presenting a loud and deep voice (much like large breasts in females). The amount of information processing going into this seems to be way overkill for survival in the environment, even in temperate climates. You do not need brain capable of memorizing the best jokes to set up traps that will outsmart rodents and big cats, in fact all other animals are *extremely* dumb by comparison.

Men innovate a lot more than women due to differences in physical strength, sex drive, neuroticism and independence of the offspring and the community, so this adaptation seems to be mostly about males one-upping their cognitive abilities. Based on this model, one could see laughter in women and outside of a competitive or courtship context (e.g. in solitude) merely as a spandrel of male-male competition.

In some popular level books I've read, I've noticed that some authors describe natural selection as if it were something like an entity or force, somehow personalized. Yet in other authors, the description is more of a broadly defined mechanism. Not that it exerts \*power\* or as a means, but more general. I hope this is making sense. It's a little strange to read natural selection as an external \*thing\* instead of as a general name for a process. Is NS something like a fundamental law like gravity? More broad than that?

We suggest that spikes, knobs, observed by negative-staining electron microscopy may be an artifact of the penetration of heavy metal stain between envelope proteins.  Indeed, the term “spike” appears to have assumed a rather imprecise, possibly misleading definition, and might best be used with caution”.

The idea is that life started on Earth and carbon is the element that was chosen. Which makes sense because carbon is a pretty great element. So this was going on for awhile and natural selection and natural pressures and changing evironment... Yadadada... Til we get to today. Modern humanity and society is here and we are producing a lot of waste. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's more of a fact. Chemistry is always happening. So then I think of current biological pressures ranging from pollution, to global warming, to the energy crisis, to politics, to money. All that stuff. All of this is leading up to a point where humans either make it off the Earth successfully or we don't. The more I read about space exploration, the more I read about how fragile the human body really is. We are not well equipped to send humans very far into space. We need serious protection from the vacuum and radiation exposure. 

So we use robots, which are great for that. Think about the Voyager missions. Those things are still going, and are leaving our solar system. That is pretty insane.

Anyway, looking at it evolutionarily, what if the natural progressions of ""life"" leads to inorganic artificial intelligence which ultimately leaves Earth and truly travels around the stars. Exploring other planets and maybe even coming in contact with other inorganic life created from some other organic life, that originated somewhere in the cosmos. I guess it kind of depends on how you define life. I'm thinking of it more as intelligence. The ability to observe the physical world around you, interpret stimuli, survive and ultimately reproduce. Which is weird to think about since we usually think about life being directly related to DNA, which is where it started. But does it always have to be that way?

When I read about whole genome duplications (WGDs), I often note that a diploid will still be considered a diploid even after a WGD event. On the other hand, a WGD is usually implicated in an Autopolyploidization. How are these boundaries drawn? Is it a feature of how mitosis/meiosis plays out? 

My best guess is that if, in a tetraploid for example, all four homologous chromosomes will stack up together, then the WGD event is defined as a Autopolyploidization. I'm no cell biologist, so I'm hopefully someone more oriented in that mode of thought will hold the key to my crisis.

More importantly, **is there a grey zone**? You can imagine a metaphase plate where you get stacks of 4 homologous (tetraploid) chromosomes next to stacks of two all recombining and preparing to separate in an orderly fashion. If this doesn't exist, what is preventing it?

50,My Apologies Dumdass Question here BUT. Accidental evolution does not make sense to me and i am trying to figure it out but having great difficulty as most articles are aimed at qualfied minds not noobs. More in text,"I have been having a bit of a mental argument with myself of late and i am trying to put t to rest. Firstly i want to state i believe in no form of deity and subscribe to no religious theories so no answers will cause offence (except pointing out the stupidity of my question).e

Right here is my basic understanding of evolution and the surce of my greatest problems. I have been led to understand each and every evolutionary development has arisen purely by accidental genetic anomalies and if the change was supportive of the organisms requirements to survive and thrive nature then kept these changes and discarded the unneeded or harmful ones. Bearing this in mind the old mathematical problem using a deck of cards and shuffling them randomly and playing the same hand EVER is so absolutely tiny that it is not worth thinking about yet in a single relatively simple organsim this randon shuffle has happened millions of times and it has happened to billions of life form with every one of them getting just the right shuffle to suite their enviroment while discarding the rest of the pack as such. How has evolution had enough time to do this. Secondly some of the genetic  accidents are so specific and so weird i find geat difficulty in understanding how the types of accident could even happen once, one specific animal wich started this all for me is when i saw a picture of a Hawk Moth a few years ago and i just could not get my hear around how such a clever change could have takne place without ANY form of intelligent intervention. The caterpillar does not know that is imitating a snake it just carries out a reflex action which happens to resemble a snake how did something like this happen and how did nature know the change was working for that species and then keep it. Surley for nature to decide which changes were beneficial some kind of statistical memory would be needed. In todays medicine which is the only thing i could think of that comes even close it takes thousands of hours of experimentation before human trials begin and only when deemed safe do humans get to test the medication, sometimes tha lab findings are wrong as happened in france a few years ago and tragedy strike some times results are far better then expected and the drug is deemed safe to enter the mainstream and sometimes despite all the research the drug is deemed useless and discarded and then occasionaly even after all the testing danerous or useless drugs make it to market and example is thalidomide although i know there was a lot of corruption going on it still made it. The above example are all arried out by intelligent beings with sofisticated equipement and STILL we crew up how has nature and evolution managed to do this trillions of times successfully and hundreds of trillions of times if you take the failed mutations into account as well. Why do we not see any of the failed genetic mutations in nature such as fossils or the more recent remains of which there are many. I do understand many animals decay in such a way as to leave no physical remains but if these genetics changes have happened so often or so long we should be seeing more of them. Even animals that were supposedly part of the evolutonary process we find alive and well today with their genetic anomolies intact, the coelacanth and surely the platapus are two exampes i can think of. I also come to the animals that supposedly dot belong where they are, a zebre does NOT use its stripes for camoflage and if it does then it is stupid because i have seen them in their natural habitat many times and they are ALWAYS the second animal you see with the Giraffe being the first.

63,Could Homo naledi have been an underground species?,"Here are my points in support:

- If you've seen the structure of the cave system they were found in, you'll see it was extremely far into the system, and anyone going in all that way just to bury their dead would have to drag a dead body with them up and down many tiny crevices. Sure, the system could have looked different back then, and maybe it would have been easier for these smaller humans to carry their dead through tight spaces, but even then, it's a lot of effort just to drop someone down a chute at the end of a seriously long and difficult cave system.

- South Africa is an ecological isolate. There is a species of wildebeest here that is different from the wildebeest found in the rest of the continent, and the same applies to a lot of other species. In many cases, animals here have evolved to lead underground lives to avoid intense heat at the surface. Best example would be the meerkat, which is closely related to the mongoose.
Could naledi be the isolated human species that chose an underground lifestyle while the rest of the species moved on?

- Humans and ape species have always been social, and have lived in hierarchies. It is just an extension of that to live a colony style lifestyle like ants or bees, or naked mole rats. 
Animals that live in colonies usually have a specific place to dispose off their dead. Imagine a whole human species living with one breeding queen and workers with specific tasks ascertained to them!

- It might also explain why we haven't found naledi fossils anywhere else, except this one underground burrow where we found a huge number of them.

- A lot of naledi's weird structural features seem to be cut out for living in underground burrows.
(i) Most notably the curved bones of their fingers, hands and feet -- which is unlike any other human species. Curved appendages are useful to free-swimming creatures, but are also a staple in species that need to dig and/or climb rocky surfaces, like they would have needed to.
(ii)They would also had very small pelvises, which is again very unlike an species that is supposed to walk upright/give birth to large-headed babies. But small pelvises would come in very handy for an underground species that constantly needs to navigate tight spaces.
(iii) Lastly, they had very small brains/heads. Again, human species evolved to get bigger brains in general with increase in meat based diets. It could well be that the small brains were the result of living in a colony structure, which functions as a collective organism with a collective brain, making the need for individual intelligence obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my two cents:

first off, imo its an interesting video

They spend the first minutes describing natural selection - what are your thoughts on their description, is it fair? it doesn't seem like too much of a strawman as i've seen on other channels.

they go on to talk about natural selection as a ""culling"" process as it eliminates negative genes, and thus can't create anything new. They don't really touch on the argument that mutations create the diversity and selection pressures then act on the diversity to select the beneficial genes (someone has already criticized that in the comments and they are apparently addressing mutation in their next video).

they go on to talk about that idea of small steps, that idea of half a wing or half an eye being better than no eye. And from what i understand they say that even those small steps are actually very complicated - the idea of a rudimentary eye which might just detect light vs dark still requires the cone cells, the wiring to the brain and the processing centers. which seems like an interesting point, It seems to ask how a very small mutation can be selected as beneficial without simultaneous concurrent mutations working synergistically with it. 

basically, they argue that each seemingly small improvement is actually a ""peak"" and to further improve would require devolution of that developed organ - which seems to be a bit off the mark, why cant it continue to improve with further small steps? but it does make me think about how could the initial system of multiple parts working together be set up, and they argue that this would come about by random selection as the individually mutating systems dont know that they should build towards a joint goal. Anyone got any recommended sources for more info on  this?

83,Why have gametophytes never evolved large forms?,"Just some thoughts about the terrestrial flora.

When we see documentaries about the greening of the land and how plants eventually evolved into trees and bushes, the whole gametophyte and sporophyte thing is rarely if ever mentioned.

The greening of the land was done by moss and similar plants; gametophytes who formed huge carpets covering everything. But the origin of larger and taller plants is the story about sporophytes.

With the exception from moss, all plants we see around us are sporophytes. So why did gametophytes stay small? The most common answer is; ""because they never evolved real roots, a vascular tissue system or mechanical support"". The question is then; why did they never evolve these traits? 

It is still not clear if gametophytes evolved from single celled algae that were already terrestrial, or if it was a primitive filamentous multicellular algae (either way, they were most likely part of biological soil crust, being protected from UV-light by a thin layer of soil and organic material).

Even if the sporophyte evolved from a single diploid cell, it gradually become an organism of its own. If this happened after the haploid generation had adapted to land, it means the sporophyte has never been aquatic. It has been terrestrial from start (some plants have since then adapted to a life in water).

In bryophytes (moss plants), the gametophyte is the dominant generation. In all other plants, the sporophyte is the dominant one. But it is possible both generations were equally dominant early in their evolution: 

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/15/exquisitely-preserved-fossil-deposit-is-a-window-on-early-life-on-land-rhynie-chert

""Sporophyte-phase plants from Rhynie such as Rhynia, Aglaophyton and Horneophyton, with root-like rhizoids and naked branching axes (leaves had yet to evolve) were first described a hundred years ago. Remarkably, their equivalent gametophyte forms have all also been identified. In modern spore-producers the emphasis is either on the gametophyte phase (in mosses and liverworts) or on the sporophyte phase (in ferns) but in the Rhynie ecosystem, both phases were independent, free-living plants of similar complexity. This could mean that the Rhynie plants are the sister group to modern vascular plants, the group which includes the ferns and all other ‘higher’ plants with water-conducting tissues.""

Considering both generations have the same genes, and if the sporophyte was a relative newcomer, they were still not as specalized from each other as they are today. 

The group of plants who evolved a dominant sporophyte, became gradually even more complex. But mosses, hornworts and liverworts appears have evolved a more simplified anatomy in both generations. But especially the sporophyte has been reduced (even if it is able to support itselv in some hornwort species). 
Perhaps an adaptation for growing on a rocky surface, while vascular plants were growing in soil.

Still, it is kind of weird how the mosses have never evolved larger forms.",evolution,1541620395,Tidemand,0,1,True,2018-11-07

See, I like to stress test systems. Often, I would try to take mathematical equasions and make them contradict themselves (with no sucsess). Essentially, trying random inputs and seeing what comes out. Jhon conway's game of life make some nice patterns, but think about whats actually possible within its rules. As its turing complete, it can basically do any computations a computer can. However, if you randomly put in inputs, whats the chance you get a result thats going to be interesting? well, we need to define interesting, which i'll say is ""focused complexity"" Essentially, it must be complex, but have a clear focus in what it is accomplishing.

For example, take a ""gun"": [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun\_(cellular\_automaton)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton))

Its focused into creating copies of a ""glider"", another arguably focused complex formation. Say we were to randomly make the area the gun first discovered ( the goseper glider gun) occupies. The imaged used in the link is 11\*39 grid squares, meaning 319 grid squares. Now, l'ets suppose that, the amount of formations that accomplish basically the same task of duplicating gliders is 100 000. The odds you get a ""glider cannon"", are therefore the number of glider gun formations divided by 2 to the power of grid cells, which gives us...

9.36 \* 10\^**-92**

See what I mean? Even if we suppose more formations, any resonable estimate gives us abysmal probability. And jhon conway's game of life is a simulation that lends itself pretty well to turing complete computation compared to physics, and a glider gun is childs play compared to a self replicating, self sustaining, evolving machine.",evolution,1541626597,SimonScience,8,1,True,2018-11-07

116,Literature on the differential immune response of plants depending on site of infection?,"Hi /r/evolution

I’m looking for literature on whether plants respond differently to pathogens depending on the site of infection. That is to say, does a plant have a greater chance of resisting a pathogen if the initial infection site is on a leaf, a stem, a flower, a root, etc.

Taking aside the fact that the probability of a pathogen making its way into the plant at these various structures may differ, I want to know if there is a differential immune response.

My suspicion is that there is since plants do not have mobile cells and thus, would rely in part on resource partitioning and potentially isolated responses.

The book Plant Resource Allocation edited by Fakhri A Bazzaz and John Grace go at length about some of the forms of resource allocations in plants. One section titled, “allocation to defensive chemicals” cites studies that show the trade offs between manufacture and storage of chemical defenses, forgone resource capture, inducible vs constitutive defenses, and the value of plant structures to be defended. However, the context of this section is that of chemical defenses against herbivores, and I’m not too sure how well this translates to immune responses.

Ideally, the literature would be a plant response to a fungal pathogen, but honestly a response to any other microbial or viral pathogen would do. My main difficulty is in finding a study that looks into this idea as I’m unsure what search terms to use. 

An offshoot (pun intended) of this question is whether plants that reproduce via vegetative reproduction (e.g. through horizontal stems/stolons) show varying levels of disease resistance. If one of the offshoots becomes diseased, is there systemic infection of all “individuals” connected via these shoots or is the disease compartmentalized to that single offshoot?

I love that you can (probably) see how evolution made us jump from this super simplistic ""alternative pathway"" to the more advanced ""lectin pathway"" and then made us end up with this complex and super functional ""classical pathway"".

Now I wanted to ask you guys, if you have more examples of human evolution on a cellular or physiological level, that shows how simple we started out and how basically randomness made us become such a highly complex being. 

I´d really love to get a tattoo that combines evolution and human physiology, since these are the two things that just don´t stop to amaze me, but it´s kind of hard to combine these two things in a image.

118,Can anyone post links and citations regarding social norms and their significance in human evolution?,"For much of my life, I've thought ""norms"" were boring. ""Yeah, yeah, people are sheep. So what?! I'm not a sheep and either are my friends. I make my own choices."" And so on...

It took a long time for me to understand how powerful social norms are, in individual behavior and emotional life and social life. Also, how deep they go. Recent research indicates that children automatically follow social norms established by other children, without any guidance from adults, and without any experience of adverse consequences for violating those norms. Young children experience norms demonstrated by other children as ""oughts"" or moral imperatives.

It took me even longer to realize that I am just about as susceptible to social norms as anyone else, and what powerful emotions they can cause in me. I'm more broad-minded, non-judgmental and non-conformist, and yet if I think I might have committed a minor social error, I suffer over it, and work hard to avoid them, just as everyone else does.

As far as I can tell, most adults, including me, often feel and reason the same way. For example, Jonathan Haidt's interesting recent research on moral reasoning and disgust seems to be investigating moral reasoning associated with unexamined and illogical social norms. Why is it wrong for a family to cook and eat a pet cat that died accidentally? Almost everybody says it's wrong, but they can't say why. Apparently, it seems wrong because ""It's just not done."" In other words, it's a norm violation.

Memes are not necessarily norms, though they often are. Norms are one kind of meme, one might say, possibly a behavioral meme rather than a verbal meme or an idea-meme. These seem like minor distinctions.

Now I'm wondering whether other eusocial animals have norms to the extent that humans do. I'm sure elephants and chimpanzees have some norms, but I'm guessing the do-as-others-do effect is much, much stronger and more detailed in humans.

Is it possible that strong susceptibility to social norms is a distinctly human adaptation? Is it reasonable to consider the possibility that dependence on social norms is one of the reasons that humans have recently out-competed other species?

I don't feel I understand this topic very well. When I try to learn more about it, I usually find boring sociological literature that acknowledges a certain tendency for humans to follow norms, without considering the matter very deeply, and most sociological literature is dismissive about evolutionary explanations.

So, I'd like to read articles or books that will help me understand this issue better. I'm a pretty big fan of evolutionary psychology - I've read most of Steven Pinker, for example, Daniel Dennett, Jared Diamond, and others of that ilk.

140,Serious question that might make me look like a horrible person,"I have read a couple of articles lately that were intended to be ""feel good"" stories about people who had various diseases...usually cancers...at fairly young ages but with amazing technology they had been able to harvest and store eggs or sperm and went on to have kids. Some of them rush to stock up their sperm or eggs when they learn they are sick. I just can't figure out why.

On the one hand, that seems great and the articles are invariably fawning all over the wonderfulness of it all.  It is amazing.

But I often feel sad for those kids. For the life of me, I cannot imagine how a person who has the genetic predisposition for these horrible diseases (genetic mutations?) would even want to take the chance of passing them along to their children....let alone PURPOSELY do it. Just for the sake of having your own biological kids? Then we will see a story in which a child tragically got the same cancer his mother had.....but the story is only about how horribly unlucky they are...but never about the game of Russian roulette they may have been playing.

Of course, none of us have perfect DNA and i know not all cancers or diseases are equally heritable. I wouldn't know where to draw the ethical line as to what type of conditions should make you not biologically procreate, or if there should even be a line. I am not saying near sighted or bald people shouldn't have kids....but geez, these parents will probably stress about feeding the kids organic applesauce as if it makes a difference....but they ignore the fact that they purposely injected the kid with seriously flawed DNA. If I knew that my DNA had a very elevated likelihood to cause cancer, I would do everything I could to keep it out of my children.

Just on an individual ethical level...It just seems horribly horribly selfish when there are other reasonable options to be a parent. I know I could love a kid just as much, if she were made from someone else's sperm instead of mine.

First off:
I just want to learn.

I am not trying to be offensive. 

I am ignorant to the topic of human evolution and am sincerely on the pursuit of knowledge.

Okay SO:

Evolution of man shows Homo neanderthalensis as the step before Homo sapiens.

sub-Saharan Africans have little to no Neanderthal DNA.

First question: Are sub-Saharan Africans not Homo sapiens since they don't have that step in evolution? If they are considered Homo sapiens, how did they skip that step or why is the Neanderthal step not needed?

I was researching our African origins and noticed that those who migrated out of Africa mated with other humans in other parts of the world.

2nd question: How were there other types of humans in other areas if we originated in Africa? Is it a timeline issue that I'm missing or what?

3rd question: Neanderthals evolved in Europe and Asia while apparently our species, Homo sapiens were evolving in Africa....but how could Homo sapiens be evolving without having mated first with Neanderthals? 

I am clearly not understanding something here lol. I'd really appreciate an explanation from someone well versed on human evolution because I've spent the past 2 hours trying to research and I'm all over the place and am at the point of just wanting a colloquial answer rather than reading through scholarly articles.

capitalism to me anyway seems to draw on a man's desire to compete the sexual dimorphism we see in most mammals seems to suggest this is the rule on our planet. so it seems to me that capitalism would manifest itself if both species were mammals and be a very practical way to progress a mammalian species.

but there are many reasons most morphologically  why  abstractions like captalism wouldn't be useful socialism would fail with this too because this species would of evolved intelligence in nature which would mean cognitive biases.which would mean they have the notion of the other and an unconscious process

(I think my line of thinking is wrong though as I don't have any proof that maternal instincti s passed down through DNA.)

33,The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug.,"This was going to be a question about defense mechanisms that activate on death, but I did a little digging and answered my own question. All the same, I’d like to share what I learned and ask a related question.

I live in Japan, and there is a common beetle that, if attacked or crushed, releases a horrible smell. 

I had initially thought this only happened at death, so I was confused as to how a trait that activates on death could become common:

The benefits of this are clear - no one wants to crush, eat, etc. the beetle, because it smells bad.

But, since this defense mechanism activates on death, how would that evolve. My understanding is that something like this has to be in place to help keep the organism alive in order to mate and produce offspring.

Assuming a proto-beetle species that has its initial generation of a mix of beetles that can and cannot produce the stench:

If the beetle can live long enough to mate and create offspring, then beetles that produce the stench and beetles that don't produce the stench would have equal chance at survival.

But my digging around showed that the beetle can activate this defense manually without dying, so that makes sense.

An interesting side note, I cannot smell these beetles very well. When I first moved them, I crushed them all the time. My coworkers complained about the smell, but I smelt nothing more than peaty dirt.

It turns out that produce a smell similar to coriander – also known as cilantro.

Interestingly, some people enjoy cilantro, others think it tastes like soap. I happen to love cilantro, so I wonder if my enjoying cilantro and my inability to really smell these beetles are related.

But after some research, I found that out of tens of thousands of ERV (Endogenous Retroviruses) elements in the human genome, only seven occupy the same sites in humans and chimpanzees.

We are not special.","they say our earth has the perfect setting for life but what is perfect, we adapted to what we have and the big question then arises why isnt there life on every planet after time like ours? life can also adapt to the setting that individual planet has just like here on earth. Who said needing water, sun and all the things that we need to be in existence is the only way life can exist. life can live in different setting and need different sources for surviving as we can see on earth, so why tf couldn't life adapt to each individual planet for its own laws to living.,, maybe there is life on each planet but not in anyway we can even imagine because how different it is (so different that we wouldnt even dream close to it).ofcourse life on earth itself came with time so possibly some planets arent old enough and have life just forming or adapting.

Also another theory of mine i just came up with- maybe when an asteroid hit our planet it had something that if put in the right setting or mixed with would create life of some sort(possibly even a germ)&gt;? maybe it had the perfect temperature and resources which make it complete and starts the long process of adapting from maybe something so minuscule as a germ which life eventually turns into something we see today??? 

i also flirted with the idea that life/creation is spontaneous and happens on the go, when i searched this up online apparently steven hawking mentioned that life happens spontaneously because something like the law of gravity exists. I kind of feel great that i came up with the same idea (not even hearing about it previously) as a fuking famous scientist. But i can disagree with it somewhat because if it is happening spontaneously isnt it already following a law that was predestined to do that if certain things are mixed together, in other words wouldnt the kind of result happen every time when having that same mix come together. (this probably made no sense to u guys but thats the best way i can explain it).  like certain things when come together will always have the same result, isnt that already predestined?? and how can life create itself spontaneously (like making its own rules/laws that it follows to be able to exist (like food, water, sun for humans)) if it did create itself spontaneously any setting can be adapted to, thus every planet would have life.

actually maybe life is created on the go and adapts to its surroundings, but then that begs to question what i previously mentioned why wouldnt all planets have different life that it can adapt to just like it did on earth to its surroundings.And  who says that the earth has the perfect setting for life, it all just adapted to its surroundings so how would u even define perfect if life is able to adapt, in this case all planets would have life that has adapted to each setting of that planet/star.

120,A challenge: Any successful experiments in abiogenesis? Is a natural OOL even possible?," 

## The following was posted on several other groups a few weeks ago. At first the response was to attack me. I responded that that was irrelevant. Can anyone name any successful experiments in chemical evolution, as abiogenesis was initially called?  No one has so far.  I am not interested in name calling and will not respond to any. I am challenging if anyone can actually discuss these issues intelligently. 

📷

I recently posted at [osf.io/p5nw3](https://osf.io/p5nw3) a preprint of a potential journal article. It provides an extremely thorough analysis of abiogenesis. There has not been a single successful experiment in the field over the past sixty years since Miller did his spark chamber experiment. No experiment has started with a suitable feedstock, acted on it with an external energy source using a plausible prebiotic process, and produced new chemicals which can be used as produced in a subsequent step. Successful abiogenesis requires the entire process to take place without failure or intervention. The first step fails and each succeeding would be harder to get past if it were to be reached. I am a Christian; as such I believe God simply put up barriers that are impossible to be crossed and made it so that an honest interpretation of observed scientific evidence reveals them. Prebiotic processes use uncontrolled energy and randomize their substrate. There is nothing to constrain them to give the required products, so they produce the wrong ones. They have done this in every experiment to date and there is no basis to expect this ever to change.

In the article a hypothesis is presented with six parts 1) There are many more chemicals not suited for an advance towards life than are suited. 2) There are no connections between the factors determining the chemicals produced naturally and those needed for an advance towards life. 3) Prebiotic processes randomize feedstock. The longer a process lasts, the more random the mixture produced becomes and hence the more remote from life. 4) The ratio between wrong chemicals and required chemicals is so great that it prevents the step from succeeding. 5) The statistical law of large numbers prevents useful fluctuations from prevailing. 6) In the later stages, the principle of emergence results in the entire cell becoming a giant chicken and egg problem. Everything requires everything else. Virchow's aphorism, all cells from cells, describes the problem.

The article does not discuss the origin of life, it merely shows that science puts up too many, too serious barriers for it to happen naturally. I am a Baptist pastor and also have a degree in physics from UCLA. I believe that these things are consistent with my understanding of the Biblical account of God as Creator. However, that discussion is a seperate issue, the discussion in the article is focused on principles of observed science; metaphysical discussion of any sort is outside its scope. This is not to deny t he importance of metaphysical issues. They just need to be discussed in a separate venue.

Ithenticate is a plagiarism checker used by almost all journals today. It is extremely thorough. There was not a single prior reference in the abstract, in the statement of the hypothesis summarized above, or in the discussion of John Sutherland's work in systems chemistry. The work presented here is completely original. It is the result of many years of analysis, which was only completed in written form a few days ago. Incidentally, Sutherland acknowledged in a recent article this year that despite his apparent successes, there are still far, far more wrong ways than right ways. He appeared to confirm implicitly the hypothesis. This is discussed. His work in systems chemistry has recently been the brightest hope for some kind of success in abiogenesis.

A co-author of the article is George Matzko, who spent almost 40 years as a professor of chemistry at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. For over twenty of those years he was also chair of the science department before retiring recently. His main contribution to the article was to get the discussion off of entropy, which few people understand, and onto randomness, which most people do. This really makes the arguments clearer.

I believe the evidence is conclusive. If I have misrepresented something, I would like to find out. This is the advantage of going to preprint before peer review submission. Fortunately, this is becoming an acceptable route today.

I believe abiogenesis is still a field in chaos because no one in it will admit to the obvious--observed science teaches us why a natural origin of life is impossible, not how it could take place.",evolution,1540127398,timstout45,15,1,True,2018-10-21

29,Natural Selection cannot be an explanatory mechanism; it cannot explain trait fixation nor speciation," NS is not, nor can it be as is currently formulated, a mechanism of speciation or trait fixation, as those who formulated the NS, the current Neo-Darwinian paradigm, propose:

When two traits are coextensive, how does NS distinguish the one that causes fitness from the trait that doesn’t (its linked free-rider)? It can’t because selection-for is an intensional notion.

The theory of natural selection states that organisms are selected for the relative fitness of their phenotypes in relation to their ecologies. Phenotypic traits are selected for their role in causing increases in fitness corresponding with the following principle:

If in a given ecology, organisms with T1 are more fit than organisms with T2, then, all else being equal, creatures with T1 will be selected and not creatures with T2. If both of these organisms are equally fit, then neither type of organism will be selected in preference to the other organism. But what if T1 and T2 are linked? Now suppose that T1 causes increased fitness and T2 does not. The traits are linked, so the correlation of T2 and fitness is the same as the correlation of T1 with fitness. Thus, all else being equal, if T1 is selected then so is T2. If T2 is selected then so is T1.

Darwin should have said that traits are selected which cause alterations in fitness in a given ecology, not that they’re correlated with alterations in fitness. But then Darwin would have needed to identify a mechanism that in a given ecology responds differently to phenotypic traits depending on whether or not they are causes of alterations of fitness of merely correlated with the causes of the alterations of fitness. In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of natural selection.

The theory of NS presumes a distinction between “selects” and “selects-for”, so for the theory to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2): (1) that NS has a mind/mental powers since intensionality is intentional, then intentional states have the ability to distinguish between coextensive traits; and (2) counter-factual supporting laws that phylogenetically link certain phylogenetic traits across different ecologies so that if you have one, you have the other. There is no agent of selection, (1) is discarded and there are no laws of selection so (2) is discarded so:

P1) For NS to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2).  
P2) NS does not satisfy (1) or (2).  
C) NS does not explain trait fixation.

Fodor's argument against NS is conceptual, thus empirical evidence is irrelevant to his argument. TNS does not explain trait fixation/speciation. At best worst, NS is false; at best, NS is a small driver of evolutionary change. But NS cannot be a mechanism since it cannot select between coextensive traits since NS is not minded (it's not an agent, it cannot intentionally choose between a fitness-enhancing trait and a linked free-rider), nor are there nomological laws that explain trait fixation. There need to be generalizeable laws, such as ""P1 phenotypes are more fit than P2 phenotypes in a given ecology"", or ""T1 causes fitness in ecology E but not T2"", or ""In ecology E, T1s are selected but not T2"" or ""Trait T in ecology E increases fitness"", or Fodor's ""All else being equal, the probability that a t1 wins a competition with a t2 in ecological situation E is p."" (What Darwin Got Wrong, pg 121) Laws of selection, meaning laws that govern the fitness of traits, need to be generalizeable across all ecologies and species; the law must determine which traits win which competitions in a given ecology.

Further touching on (1) and (2): NS needs to act on counterfactuals; but, as said in (1) and (2), it cannot act on counterfactuals because NS is not an agent (it cannot choose between two locally coextensive traits), nor are there laws of selection that are generalizable across all ecologies that explain trait fixation.

But, on the artificial selection point: Darwin was wrong to compare NS with animal breeders choosing traits: Animal breeders have minds; they can select-for and against traits (those terms are intensional); NS cannot choose between traits because it lacks a mind and there are no nomological laws that explain trait fixation.

I should touch on one more thing here: the claim from neo-Darwinists that species are ""perfectly fit"" for their ecologies on the basis of fitness-enhancing traits being selected-for their contribution to fitness in a given ecology is either a tautology or irrelevant to how traits evolve. Take this argument:

P1) Niches are individuated post hoc by reference to the phenotypes that live in said niche.

P2) If the organisms weren’t there, the niche would not be there either.

C) Therefore there is no fitness of phenotypes to lifestyles that explain said adaptation.

In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of ""natural selection"".",evolution,1535508238,Race--Realist,1,0,True,2018-08-28

69,"Why don't we see different evolutionary stages of any large animal living contemporarily more often, if ever?","I just thought of this and find it puzzling so decided to ask.

Why don't we see various evolutionary stages of large organisms living at the same time? Evolution and branching works like a trail through time. So why don't we see preceding/adjacent forms more frequently? Like for example, populations of 5 obvious stages of the same horse line. It doesn't necessarily have to be a horse. My point is that current iteration of ""wild horse"" is certainly not some kind of peak or that superior to its evolutionary ancestors to ensure not just its survival but also extinction of all (most) previous forms.

I am not aware if such occurrences exist but I am pretty sure they are not frequent (we wouldn't need fossils if this was so).

84,Two questions about evolution - perhaps I am misunderstanding the impetus for change.,"From my understanding of evolution, evolution occurs through random genetic mutations that are evolutionarily advantageous. This often leads to people asking questions like ""What is the evolutionary benefit of being left-handed?""

In reality, shouldn't there be a caveat that random genetic mutation needs to NOT be DIS-advantageous in order for evolution to occur? 

Using left-handedness as an example again - doesn't it merely not have to impede survival and procreation in order to get passed along? It doesn't have to serve a purpose, it just doesn't have to hold a species back.

And to be clear, I am not asking about left-handedness specifically, I'm just using it as an example - there may be a benefit to left-handedness. My point is about genetic change in general. Clearly a non-hindering mutation can spring up and be passed along w/out having to have a benefit.

My other question is about blind cave fish. I have read about cave fish that have lost sight through evolution. While sight is unneeded in cave that has no light, why would the eyes disappear? 

If I were playing an evolution themed video game and could guide the survival of in-game species, I would clearly remove the eyes of a cave fish (note, I am not arguing for intelligent design, just pointing out that I can see the reason for being blind in a dark cave).

19,The flaws that I see with the Savanna hypothesis as an explanation for human bipedalism,"The Savanna hypothesis (or, as I like to call it, forage and carry as that's really the core of the hypothesis, but that's just me) seems to be popular on this sub as a way to account for the evolution of bipedalism in humans. This hypothesis was referred to by several folks in another thread I'd started on this sub. That's fine, I'm not interested in 'debunking' the hypothesis or anything of that nature, but some folks seem unaware of the assumptions the theory is dependent on. The theory has its merits I suppose, but it most certainly has its flaws. Personally, I consider it inadequate but your mileage may vary. Here are the problems I see with it.

- The Last Common Critter (LCC) between humans and chimpanzees wandered out onto the savanna prior to becoming bipedal

The Savanna hypothesis assumes that moving into the grasslands came before bipedalism evolved. That's hardly a given. We don't know where the LCC lived. There is no reason why it couldn't have evolved to walk on two feet in the forest and _then_ wandered out into the grasslands. It would have made carrying stuff a lot easier from the start, after all.

Why venture out into an environment you're not well suited for when you're already in an environment you _are_? Tree climbing was a trait that appears to have remained with the human lineage until the emergence of _Homo_. I.e., tree climbing remained in place for something on the order 10 million years or more*. That suggests to me the LCC, and beyond, didn't wander far from trees. So why assume they spent any significant time out in a savanna environment where trees are few and far between?

It could have happened, sure, and I'm not discounting the possibility. Not in the least. I can think of at least one explanation for why that would have happened. Perhaps the competition for resources in the forest drove a subpopulation out into the fringes of the forest and eventually deeper into the savanna. I don't see a problem with that, but let's not put it out there as if we know for a fact that's what happened.

- The LCC had a kind of base camp arrangement where some members of the clan remained while the rest foraged afield

This is basically arguing that LCC males engaged in some kind of provisioning behavior. Did they? How do we know? 

We don't know what kind of social structure the LCC had. Was it a harem with a single breeding male and several females? Were the LCC monogamous or did they just breed with whoever? There isn't even a consensus on the social structures of _Australopethicus afarensis_, a species for which we have actual fossils. On what basis can we assert that some LCCs camped in place while others went out and brought food back? Why not just travel as a group in order to obtain the necessary resources? This behavior is central to the hypothesis, but there's no evidence that's what was happening.

- The LCC relied on hunting in order to survive

The Lucy specimen of the species _Australopethicus afarensis_ seems to suggest otherwise. It had a conical rib cage similar to modern chimpanzees and gorillas. In fact, one of the things that has always struck me about the fossil is how human like it looks from the waist down and how ape like its torso is. If that isn't a transitional fossil, then the term has no meaning.

Anyway, back on topic, this indicates room was needed for a large stomach and the longer intestinal tract required to digest plants. This appears to be [supported by wear patterns on the teeth.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120717084813.htm) The diet of Australopethicus anamensis_ (which that article is addressing) was focused on _""seeds, leaves and corms, as it is with the baboons of today.""_\*\* The article contrasts that to _Australopethicus afarensis_ and suggests that species ate more fruit but otherwise shared a similar diet.

If eating meat as a primary food source was an early adaptation, it would have carried over into later species and it doesn't appear that happened.*** In which case the provisioning behavior assumption falls by the way side as well.

- Bipedalism was a likely solution to the problems presented by life on the savanna

Why become bipedal in order to solve the problems of life on the savanna? No other species did that. This builds off of the provisioning behavior assumption and since there seems to be little support for that, this assumption is not very defensible either. Fruits, grasses, seeds, tubers, and the like can be eaten on the spot and there would be no need to carry them elsewhere. Besides, one can't carry much of that by hand even if they are freed from supporting the body while walking.

- The LCC was quadrupedal from the outset

There isn't a consensus that this was the case as far as I can find. As [this article on the britannica.com site puts it,](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-evolution/Theories-of-bipedalism) _""Some scientists assume that the pre-bipedal primates were terrestrial quadrupeds, perhaps even knuckle-walkers like modern-day chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. Conversely, it is also possible that the first habitual walkers were already well prepared for terrestrial bipedality, having adaptations for running bipedally among branches and boughs, standing upright to forage overhead, and climbing vertical tree trunks and vines.""_

The experts on the subject aren't in agreement on this point, so let's not get ahead of ourselves. I have no real opinion on this except to say I think it has merit. The thing I like about it in particular is _""[w]hen walking on the ground, gibbons stand up straighter than chimpanzees, which are occasionally bipedal.""_ I've long felt standing upright was a necessary precursor to walking upright (hence my flawed attempt at appealing to rock throwing to account for it) and this satisfies that need. But, maybe not.

In summary, I don't reject the Savanna hypothesis outright (I hardly have the credentials to make such a claim), but it really doesn't seem terribly likely.

---

\* Although the lack of grasping feet by the time _Australopethicus_ came on the scene may militate against that.

\*\* Notice the reference to baboons, a grassland primate that isn't bipedal. Savanna living doesn't not seem to give rise to bipedalism very easily.

\*\*\* By the by, that's why I've abandoned (I prefer 'put aside', but I'm not going to split hairs here) my little rock throwing hypothesis. It was fun to play around with, but it really doesn't hold water. Hunting, whether or not rocks were involved, does not seem to have been a factor in the evolution of human bipedalism. Add to that the lack of evidence for the necessary adaptations to facilitate throwing stuff, and yeah, it really doesn't work. I still hold that standing would have been a necessary precursor adaptation, but even that's not a given.

I know that they have varying degrees of appearance, but I'm mostly focusing on the similarities that they share that their ancestors don't.

Why did they mostly lose their tales? Why are they bigger? Why did they evolve the kinda body that allows them to sit down the way that they do and drag their bodies across the forest floor with their knuckles, or to occasionally stand up on two legs? And with all that they also hop up on a tree from time to time. What circumstances led to the kinda body plan that seems to be designed for living in trees and on the ground? Their are other animals that do inhabit both trees and the ground. Come to think of it, most species that do inhabit trees do come to the ground on occasion, but why did great apes evolve their specific appearances for this lifestyle?

And when it comes to ""Behavior"" (for lack of a better word) why are they so Intelligent? I know that the Great apes I'm referring to aren't as intelligent as the Great Apes known as humans but on their own they still are quite an intelligent bunch. What circumstances led to the development of that characteristic?

And the mom (a teacher, not joking) said to me ""I'm not a total creationist or anything, but I do think that it's odd that Darwin's theory was never really questioned...""  

And I responded ""Darwin was actually planning to be a preacher/reverend.  And he never actually dealt with the cause of life, only how it progressed once here, leaving it open, because who knows...""   and trailed off, when we both got distracted by an event happening.  

Flash forward a few days and I'm talking to a family member in the presence of mom, and the client said something about this chickens coming after dinosaurs.  I said ""Yes, those dinosaurs were on the earth before chickens evolv---appeared""

It is just what happens when you let particles bounce long enough.

The problem now is that in our universe we(or at least I) are actually conscious.  
So if consciousness is an emergent property of complex sytems(or brains,neurons,atoms) in our universe how can a universe without that property describe it just as we can?  
That would be like a universe without dark matter perfectly describing dark matter to us and we'd be like wow we have exactly that stuff right here what a coincidence.

This thought experiment is an argument against the what I think still best theories of consciousness like the [Integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory).

91,"On natural selection of the laws of nature, Artificial life and Open-ended evolution, Universal Darwinism, Occam's razor","Greetings,

I seek advice or any other help available regarding creating a specific mathematical model. It’s origin is at the intersection of the following areas:

* fundamental physics (a bit),
* the theory of evolution (a lot),
* metaphysics (a lot),
* foundations of mathematics and computability (should be a lot).

The problem I’m trying to solve can be described as to _**create the simplest model possible in which the evolution of the laws of nature arises from the natural selection of structures**_. This approach implies indeterminism and postulates random and spontaneous nature of some events. It is also assumed that the universe had the beginning (the first moment of existence). This task is meant to provide the tychism doctrine by Charles Peirce with a mathematically accurate dynamic model. 

The mathematical model is intended to describe the process of changing of a discrete structure (like graph, consisting of interconnected atomic parts). Moreover, it should be the process of development and complication of the structure (it should be capable of producing even complex “intelligent” agents after some presumably great time). And this discrete structure is a medium on which the natural selection works on (there can be selected individuals and environment, natural selection postulates hold).

The idea is attractive because it assumes that the beginning of the Universe was simple and self-justifying and can be described by the mathematical model that is obvious in the retrospective: just like Darwin's idea of evolution and natural selection: they are obvious, but until they were formulated it was really hard to assume them. This research program is a special case of the _Open-ended evolution_ problem (OEE) that has extra constraints that come from metaphysics (I also hope they may help to solve OEE problem).

**P.S.** (on computability)

The only connection to computability is that in the model to build individuals presumably should incorporate recursive algorithms that change the environment (that is presumably the other individuals). I tried to imagine lambda functions or primitive recursive functions as basic ontological atoms (to incorporate to graph-like space) but failed miserably.

13,Selection on non-coding region.,"In terms of adaptation/novelty, the prevailing idea is that protein-coding regions aren't likely to experience much change because evolutionary constraints on protein-coding genes is high (relative to non-coding regions). Therefore, because of relaxed evolutionary constraints (relative to coding regions), we expect higher rates of evolutionary change on non-coding regions. Particularly, for the evolution of complex traits like limbs, there has been a shift in conventional wisdom: now, more attention is placed on regulatory regions/elements as sites of evolutionary novelty compared to protein-coding regions, and the above logic is typically cited. But, given that the same small-effect variants keep popping up in almost all GWAS studies for most complex traits, should we really expect regulatory regions to be less constrained than protein-coding regions? If regulatory elements and networks are pleiotropic (most probably are), when mutations arise, they should in theory affect multiple traits and that's just as bad as a deleterious mutation in a protein-coding gene -- AND, even if the change is advantageous for one particular trait, it's most probably not advantageous for all.

So, if a non-coding region regulates transcription for multiple traits, why should we expect there to be higher rates of molecular evolution here compared to a protein-coding region, which, may only be important for a single trait? My problem understanding isn't that non-coding regions don't, on average, experience relaxed evolutionary constraint (relative to protein-coding regions)...it's more that this widely-peddled statement, isn't useful, at all. To me, the more accurate statement would be: 'some regulatory regions or non-coding regions (I know they aren't interchangeable) experience relaxed evolutionary constraints, relative to most protein-coding regions', but of course that's too complex to be a useful justification for more research being performed on regulatory regions.

But the amniotic egg orginated in a damp and moist environment, and most likley absorbed a much of its water from the substrate it was surrounded by, just like many eggs does today. 

Apparently it only evolved ones. The amniotic lineage leading to the mammals split from the one leading to the reptiles about 320 million years ago, according to sources. So it must have been present some time before that (but after their ancestors evolved internal fertilization).

The first amniotes were tiny insectivores, and looked like present day salamanders and small lizards. So obvioulsy their eggs were tiny as well. But they had to contain enough nutrients and water (some of it absorbed from the environment) to allow them to go through and eventually skip the whole larval stage inside the egg. When they hatched, they had to be big enough to survive on land. 

Today we have amphibians, both frogs, salamanders and caecilians, with internal fertilization that lay their eggs on land and complete their larval stage inside them. While their eggs can have a rubbery shell, they don't have the membranes we find in the amniotic egg. After all these million of years, the amphibians have never evolved their own version of an amniotic egg. And they seem to survive fine without it, even if they can't be laid in dry areas. So why (and how) did our ancestors evolve these membranes? If it was not to prevent desiccation, what was the selection pressure?

Even if the animals were small, their eggs were probably still bigger than terrestrial amphibian eggs laid by same sized animals. The bigger the offspring, the bigger the chance of survival. Could the answer be gas exhange because of a bigger fetus? And/or a way to deal with the waste the fetus produced in its own little pond? A shell would obvioulsy give mechanical support, and if it was relatively dry it would also make it less likely to be attaced by fungus. But modern day amphibians could still benefit from it.

In nature we rarely see new inventions. Most of the time it is just modifications of already existing structures. So what if out ancestors modified structures that were lost in modern amphibians, and when some of them started to lay eggs on land, they could only use what they had left.

Another main difference between amphibians and amniotes is that amphibians use so-called buccal pumping to breath, while amniotes use their ribs. Because modern amphibians are so small, they can also use their moist skin as an extra lungs, but this adatation is said to be a secondary evolutionary trait (there is also at least one frog living in a dry environment that only breath with their lungs, just like amniotes).   
This is another bonus from skipping the larval stage. In amphibian larvae, the ribs are attachments for muscles that are for swimming. When they leave the water, it is too late in their development to give the ribs a different purpose. 

The amniotes hatched as small adults, and didn't need to swim like amphibian larvae. So their ribs became a part of the amniote breathing system instead. When they no longer had to use their mouth cavity as part of their breathing procedure, their jaws and skull could become more specialized. But the tiny amphibians could still allow themselves to be a little more specialized than the huge temnospondyls who had a more conservative anatomy.

Again, none of the present day amphibians who don't have a larval stage have ever evolved a rib cage specialized for breathing. Are the ribs too reduced perhaps (most frogs don't have ribs at all)? 

It may seem like obvious evolutionary steps on the road to becoming fully terrestrial animals, but as it has only happened once (as we are aware of), and none of the other tetrapods have been able to repeat it, the whole ""it's simply an adaptation to a drier climate"" seems way too easy, and doesn't really explain how they originated in the first place.",evolution,1530332474,Tidemand,18,10,True,2018-06-30

49,New peer reviewed scientific paper doubts the explanatory power of our current understanding of Darwinian Evolution,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798

""Before the extensive sequencing of DNA became available it would have been reasonable to speculate that random copying errors in a gene sequence could, over time, lead to the emergence of new traits, body plans and new physiologies that could explain the whole of evolution. However the data we have reviewed here challenge this point of view.""

""It suggests that the Cambrian Explosion of multicellular life that occurred 0.54 billion years ago led to a sudden emergence of essentially all the genes that subsequently came to be rearranged into an exceedingly wide range of multi-celled life forms - Tardigrades, the Squid, Octopus, fruit flies, humans – to name but a few.""

The paper discusses the complexity and genes of organisms such as the octopus and squid appearing without precedent.

""However the genetic divergence of Octopus from its ancestral coleoid sub-class is very great, akin to the extreme features seen across many genera and species noted in Eldridge-Gould punctuated equilibria patterns (below). Its large brain and sophisticated nervous system, camera-like eyes, flexible bodies, instantaneous camouflage via the ability to switch colour and shape are just a few of the striking features that appear suddenly on the evolutionary scene.""

""The transformative genes leading from the consensus ancestral Nautilus (e.g., Nautilus pompilius) to the common Cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to Squid (Loligo vulgaris) to the common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris) are not easily to be found in any pre-existing life form.""

The paper considers the plausibility of extra terrestrial origin of such organisms. 

""it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant “future” in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large. Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm.""

""However consistent with this conclusion are the recent RNA editing transcriptome-wide data on the somatic RNA diversification mechanisms in the behaviourally sophisticated Cephalopods such as Octopus. These data demonstrate extensive evolutionary conserved adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) mRNA editing sites in almost every single protein-coding gene in the behaviorally complex coleoid Cephalopods (Octopus in particular), but not in nautilus (Liscovitch-Brauer et al., 2017). This enormous qualitative difference in Cephalopod protein recoding A-to-I mRNA editing compared to nautilus and other invertebrate and vertebrate animals is striking."" 

""almost every protein coding gene having an evolutionary conserved A-to-I mRNA editing site isoform, resulting in a nonsynonymous amino acid change (Liscovitch-Brauer et al., 2017). This is a virtual qualitative jump in molecular genetic strategy in a supposed smooth and incremental evolutionary lineage - a type of sudden “great leap forward”.

""Unless all the new genes expressed in the squid/octopus lineages arose from simple mutations of existing genes in either the squid or in other organisms sharing the same habitat, there is surely no way by which this large qualitative transition in A-to-I mRNA editing can be explained by conventional neo-Darwinian processes, even if horizontal gene transfer is allowed.""

The paper considers the possibility of new genes being extra terrestrial imports to Earth. 

""One plausible explanation, in our view, is that the new genes are likely new extraterrestrial imports to Earth - most plausibly as an already coherent group of functioning genes within (say) cryopreserved and matrix protected fertilized Octopus eggs.

Thus the possibility that cryopreserved Squid and/or Octopus eggs, arrived in icy bolides several hundred million years ago should not be discounted (below) as that would be a parsimonious cosmic explanation for the Octopus' sudden emergence on Earth ca. 270 million years ago. Indeed this principle applies to the sudden appearance in the fossil record of pretty well all major life forms, covered in the prescient concept of “punctuated equilibrium” by Eldridge and Gould advanced in the early 1970s (1972, 1977); and see the conceptual cartoon of Fig. 6. Therefore, similar living features like this “as if the genes were derived from some type of pre-existence"" (Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, 1981) apply to many other biological ensembles when closely examined.""

The paper calls for a paradigm shift on our understanding of Darwinian evolution.

""We are of the conviction that an extensive Cosmic Biology is the most plausible driver of the evolutionary complexity of life on Earth, and the recent report by Aiewsakun and Katzourakis (2017) provides a major jig-saw piece of evidence fitting in and consistent with this picture.""

""Darwinian evolution and its various non-Darwinian terrestrial drivers (Wickramasinghe and Steele, 2016) are therefore most likely caused by the continuing supply of new virions and micro-organisms from space with their genetic impact events written all over our genomes (Wickramasinghe, 2012). Indeed a strong case can be made for hominid evolution involving a long sequence of viral pandemics, each one of which was a close call to total extinction of an evolving line. The most crucial genes relevant to evolution of hominids, as indeed all species of plants and animals, seems likely in many instances to be of external origin, being transferred across the galaxy largely as information rich virions.""

The paper calls for a complete revision of the standard neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. 

""Indeed there is much contemporary discussion, observations and critical analysis consistent with this position led by Corrado Spadafora, Yongsheng Liu, Denis Noble, John Mattick and others, that developments such as Lamarckian Inheritance processes (both direct DNA modifications and indirect, viz. epigenetic, transmissions) in evolutionary biology and adjacent fields now necessitate a complete revision of the standard neo-Darwinian theory of evolution or “New Synthesis "" that emerged from the 1930s and 1940s.""",evolution,1530813666,NovelQuote,25,0,True,2018-07-05

55,The Evolutionary argument for the causal efficacy of consciousness,"What do people think of William James' evolutionary argument for the causal efficacy of consciousness? The argument can be summarised as follows:

1.       Evolution occurs through natural selection of favourable traits

2.       Pleasurable feelings are generally associated with events which enhance survival prospects and painfull feelings  with the opposite

3.      Given (1), the correlation in (2) must have evolved through the processes of natural selection

4.       If pleasure and pain had no physical effects then natural selection would have no effect on them

5.      Therefore, subjective experiences such as pleasure and pain  have physical effects.

Scientist and author Graham-Cairns Smith considered the argument a ""bombshell in the foundations of science"".

85,A thought while reading “The World without Us”,"The nonfiction book by Alan Weisman describes what would happen if all of mankind were to disappear (i.e how long it will take for nature to reclaim the land and through what processes).

I’m not that far into it, but the chapter I’m on is sort of describing our legacy. I thought one section of the chapter had a nice evolution-related insight.

Weisman explains how the genetic analyses of Red-tailed monkeys and Blue monkeys, two species with different chromosome counts and very distinct appearances, shows that the two species diverged some 3-5 million years ago adjusting to distinct environments. But, now a researcher, Kate Detwiler, a Ph.D. Candidate at New York University’s Center for the Study of Human Origins (at least during 2005, idk her affiliation today) has been finding hybrid offspring. Weisman explains that while the two species were originally geographically isolated, the barrier was eliminated as new forests filled in. The two species shared the niche and eventually became marooned in the small stretch of forest as the surrounding area was transformed to cassava crop lands. Detwiler hypothesizes that the dwindling species counts drove individuals to desperate (or creative) survival measures. If (and it’s a pretty big if, in my opinion) the hybrids are viable and, on the off chance, even more successful then either parent species, these hybrids would be, in a sense, human artifacts.

While the idea of humans generating hybrids via artificial selection isn’t anything new to me (e.g. many crop species today), the idea that humans may have inadvertently led to the hybridization of two species due to habitat destruction was something I hadn’t thought about previously.

113,My 'theory' on the evolution of human bipedalism.,"These are my thoughts on the question. I don't know if anyone else has proposed this, but I haven't seen it. I consider this a 'theory' because I can think of two at least ways in which it could be falsified. I'll touch on those as I go. Of course, I haven't put a lot of scientific rigor into developing this and so calling it a 'theory' may be a bit optimistic, but I'll go with the term for now.

First, an initial assumption. I'm assuming that the LCC (the Last Common Critter that linked humans and chimpanzees) were arboreal and were not well adapted for ground locomotion. This assumption is key to my suggestion here and, if we find it to be false (i.e., if the LCC was already reasonably well adapted to walking on all fours similar to chimpanzee knuckle walking), then that would probably be the first falsification of this theory. 

However, I don't think so. I think the LCC was certainly capable of scampering around on the ground using all fours, but I don't think it was particularly well adapted for it, preferring to stay in the trees most of the time. Still, when the LCC came down from the trees (perhaps due to deforestation?) it would use all four legs to get around because that would be more stable than trying to use just the two hind legs. Consequently, there would be a selective advantage to becoming better at quadrupedal location.

There have been arguments made that bipedal locomotion is more efficient and offers various other advantages (heat regulation, for example) over quadrupedal locomotion. However, it seems to me that those advantages don't really kick in until the LCC was at least already partially adapted to walking on two legs. I imagine that the stability of four legs would by itself outweigh those factors initially. I suspect that's why chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans (et al) use all four limbs to move about the ground. There would be selective pressure to evolve in that direction.

So, what led to the human stride (which evidently was largely in place by the time australopithecines arrived on the scene)? I think it's because, initially, there was a selective advantage for _standing_ on two feet. Walking evolved once the LCC had a largely upright posture while standing.

Of course, that begs the question why stand in the first place? My answer is: in order to throw rocks. Rocks make excellent ranged weapons. One needn't put an edge on a rock to throw it, so crafting stone 'tools' (as we normally think of them) wouldn't factor in. That would come later. Important to this theory is that throwing a rock allows one to kill prey at a distance (or, at the least, stun and/or injure it making for an easier capture and kill).

I'm proposing, therefore, that the a subgroup of LCCs, once they began to move about on the ground to a large degree, starting using rocks to hunt with as well as to defend themselves from rival groups. If another group of critters were acting in an aggressive manner, throwing rock at them would help drive them away without having to get up close and personal about it. And, likely, those groups would take the hint and adopt the behavior themselves.

This would be true as well if a predator was threatening the local troupe of LCCs. They could drive it away by pelting it with rock from a safe distance. It could even be a way to drive a predator off its kill. If they came across a large cat, say, eating the antelope it had just killed, they could throw rocks at it to scare it off. The LCCs could them come in and avail themselves of the remains, something they wouldn't have access to otherwise. And, of course, rocks make good hammers, giving easier access to bone marrow and brain matter. Slicing and dicing, as I stated above, would come later once later australopithecines figured out how to craft an edge on their rocks.

My second assumption (and another point of falsification, as I see it) is that it is more efficient (and thereby more effective) to throw a rock while standing up rather than having three limbs on the ground. By standing, the LCC could use its hind legs and hips to put more energy into the throw. As the LLC became better adapted at standing upright, it would affect how it walked and it is here that the advantages to true bipedalism would kick in and drive the LCC to just using two legs to get around rather than all four.

Of course, this 'theory' can be falsified on at least the two points I've raised, but I don't know if it would be possible to provide supporting evidence for it. How does one demonstrate this sort of behavior in the fossil record, for example? I don't know. So, take this for whatever it's worth.",evolution,1532213868,RThompson654321,30,0,True,2018-07-21

All the other animals either can’t physically use tools or they don’t have full and deliberate control of their body parts. Is our advanced state purely the result of our naturally selected physical state?

The crux of my point is that intelligence exists among many different species but perhaps human physical attributes have enabled us to develop and build upon and therefore reinforce natural selection toward the advanced state we are today.

For example we began with a huge telephone that was connected by a wire to the wall, then designed wireless phones, computers, iPhones, Siri, Alexa, and now robots that mimic self awareness. This is a form of evolution (not of a living being but of something that has many traits of a living being). If we develop a software that is so self aware and so complex that it is indistinguishable from humans and can from there create its own AI, is this not in some way a form of reproduction?

This applies to Quantum Mechanics, black holes, and consciousness.

3. Consciousness in the mind can be altered \(even to the point that it feels like it isn't there\)

46,Beginner's question about MRCA and Identical Ancestors Point,"Hi all. I am brand new to learning about evolutionary biology and am currently reading the Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins. In the early chapters, he explains how all humans alive today have a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). He then extrapolates and explains that, if you continue to go back in time, you will get to the Identical Ancestors Point, where every human is either a universal ancestor to every human alive today or zero humans alive today.

I understand the MRCA, but do not fully understand the logic behind the IAP. Here is what really confuses me. At the point of the MRCA, there were humans alive who are ancestors to a subset of humans alive today, but not all humans alive today (let's call those ancestors G1 for simplicity). If we go to the IAP, we now only have humans that are either ancestors to all humans alive today, or no humans alive today. So, at the stage of IAP, where are the ancestors of G1? Wouldn't G1's ancestors have to have been alive at the stage of IAP? And if they were, isn't that proof that, at IAP, there have to be some humans who are ancestors of only a subset of humans alive today?

Massive Genetic Study Reveals 90 Percent Of Earth’s Animals Appeared At The Same Time

http://www.techtimes.com/articles/228798/20180530/massive-genetic-study-reveals-90-percent-of-earth-s-animals-appeared-at-the-same-time.htm

Landmark new research that involves analyzing millions of DNA barcodes has debunked much about what we know today about the evolution of species.

In a massive genetic study, senior research associate at the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller University Mark Stoeckle and University of Basel geneticist David Thaler discovered that virtually 90 percent of all animals on Earth appeared at right around the same time.

More specifically, they found out that 9 out of 10 animal species on the planet came to being at the same time as humans did some 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.

""This conclusion is very surprising,"" says Thaler, ""and I fought against it as hard as I could.""

In analyzing the COI of 100,000 species, Stoeckle and Thaler arrived at the conclusion that most animals appeared simultaneously. They found that the neutral mutation across species were not as varied as expected. Neutral mutation refers to the slight DNA changes that occur across generations. They can be compared to tree rings because they can tell how old a certain specie or individual is.

https://phe.rockefeller.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stoeckle-Thaler-Final-reduced.pdf

Several convergent lines of evidence show that mitochondrial diversity in modern humans follows from sequence uniformity followed by the accumulation of largely neutral diversity during a
population expansion that began approximately 100,000 years ago. 

A straightforward hypothesis is that the extant populations of almost all animal species have arrived at a similar result consequent to a similar process of expansion from mitochondrial uniformity within the last one to several hundred thousand years.

Mostly synonymous and apparently neutral variation in mitochondria within species shows a similar quantitative pattern across the entire animal kingdom. The pattern is that that most—over 90% in the best characterized groups—of the approximately five million barcode sequences cluster into groups with between 0.0% and 0.5% variance as measured by APD, with an average APD of 0.2%.",evolution,1527893360,CatalaticPrime,0,1,True,2018-06-01

I had read the selfish Gene, I was a big fan of the notion that we act as Gene carriers, fueled by those genes to pass them on. But, I just realize that this may be wrong. My biology teacher always referred to fitness as the end product of an individual’s journey through life, that the passing on of that individual’s DNA was the only factor that fueled natural selection. But, parents and children do not share the exact same genes (only about half if not less comes from one parent). Yes, a parent shares more genes with their child than another member of their species, even more so in comparison to another species. But, as many parents in the natural world protect their young, even though their exact DNA is not shared by them, would it not make sense for organisms to protect other individuals with similar DNA as them? This altruistic behavior would be less frequent of course, but should be observable in social creatures. It is even possible then, that this would call for the protecting of a member of a closely related species.

138,Shark evolution- earliest or the most interesting looking ancestor?,"Hello guys!  
I'm trying to research this topic on my own, but since I don't really know what online sources are the most reliable to ask about this, I hoped you could maybe give me some insight. If you do know good sources regarding the timeline of the evolution of different species, please do feel free to share them!  


So the thing is this: I need the earliest known ancestor of modern sharks, one that we know how it looked like. I've found on Wikipedia (is Wikipedia a reliable source in your opinion btw? I started my research from there so I hope it is), that some scales and teeth were discovered from 420 million years ago, and that the sharks of that time looked different to what we know now- but I couldn't find their species nor any sort of a guess as to what they looked like. Which leaves me with Cladoselache, which existed around 370 million years ago, and Xenacanthida from the Lower Carboniferous period.  


So basically, is there anything I'm wrong about or do you know something else about this topic? The base idea is to make a specie of today's shark (probably the great white) next to it's extinct ancestors, to talk about evolution a bit and see how my followers react to that, but I don't want to put some incorrect information in there and I haven't ever actually researched the evolution of a single specie, so this is a bit new to me regarding reliable sources.",evolution,1529479313,Vicky135246,9,6,True,2018-06-20
140,My thoughts on the evolution of dogs,"So, the current theory everyone hears about the evolution of dogs is that wolves followed man around, feeding on their leftover scraps. Over time, the wolves that are the least shy get closer humans, and have a better chance of getting first dibs on any scraps. They continue to get closer until wolves and humans are living side-by-side, which is when man begins intetionally feeding them, starting the domestication of the dog.

I have a few problems with this theory. First of all is, why? Why does man start to give away food to begging dogs? This is prehistoric times we're talking about. Food wasn't plentiful like it is today. Food was cherished. I think it pretty unlikey people just decided to give away precious food to the nearby animals with nothing in return.

Another overlooked assumption is the fact that dogs are very skilled hunters, much more so than humans. They have been perfecting they're hunting skills long before humans decided to try it. So if wolves are having a hard time finding a meal, what makes you think this clumsy ape on two legs is gonna catch something. I think this gives humans far too much credit.

Heres what I think really happened: Back when man was still dependant on hunting for food, they had a pretty hard time keeping up with canines. Even though man had some pretty crafty skills, they were still relativly new to hunting, and just couldn't compete with speed and sense of smell that the existing carnivors had. But, what they did have were much bigger brains, and some pretty impressive wepons like fire, and flint. I have no doubt that man had an easy time defending their catch, but actually catching it was the problem. And what do humans do when others have something they need? They steal, and its very likely early man did as well. Mans intellegence and deadly tools mad it very easy to simply follow the wolves, and when they catch something, take it from them. This seems like it would have been an easy, and very tempting option, as opposed to doing it all yourself.

So, what happens then? It's not going to take long to realize that if your taking the meal away from the wolves, the wolves will starve. In that case, you're forsed to find a new pack of wolves to follow, so it would have been in mans best interest to make sure the dogs were well fed too. At that point, both man and dog were dependant on each other, and the groups that were most cooperative with each other had the best hunting success. Wolves that had a more tame personallity could better trust humans, and allow them to participate in the hunt, creating a powerful team, with all the advantage of both dog and man.",evolution,1529540108,chaoking3119,19,0,True,2018-06-20

147,How do we Know what we Know?,"So, I've been reading a lot of Jonathan Haidt, Kahneman, and David Sloan Wilson on human evolution and rationality. The basic gist is that human rationality is an evolutionary byproduct that helps humans function as a community. Our ability to manifest culture helped drive our evolution, create egalatarian societies, improve kin selection, ward off competing tribes, and gather/hunt with greater efficiency. Our sense of right and wrong is not ""rational"" but communal. Our values are based on what benefits our community, since it was more advantageous and this adaptive for us to be respected within a community rather than ""right"" as anyone who has had a Thanksgiving dinner can attest to.

But these works mainly tell us why we think the way we do about decision-making and moral values. My question is, is there any research (preferably books) on evolutionary epistemology? We are getting a pretty good grasp on why we say ""this is right"" or ""this should be"" but is there anything on how we evolved our understanding of ""this is true?"" How do determine such things? And why? Is it because of authority? Do our communities shape truth for us, just as they shapes values? Or is there a kind of truth that we were able to determine that helps us think more ""rationally"" in the strictest sense?

I guess what I'm asking is, what are the evolutionary mechanism that enable us to form beliefs about ""true"" facts rather than moral ""facts""? What mechanisms helped us determine scientific and historical truths, and is our epistemology multifaceted (community, authority, traditions, body and social rhythms, rationality, memory and experince, etc.) or is it singular (neurochemisty or desire for acceptance in the group)?

148,"The Exodus, Harry Potter, and Stuart Mill's Stories","John Stuart Mill was an advocate that stories not only shape us as people but teach us what to think and how to feel. It isn't enough to see a sunrise and believe that it is beautiful, we must feel that it is beautiful if we are to come to any true conclusions about the world. It isn't enough to agree that the Holocaust happened, we must feel the horror and tragedy of such immense death and cruelty if we are to make any rational decisions about how to love our lives in light of objective truth.

To confirm this, studies have shown that people who have read Harry Potter, especially as children, are more empathetic, adaptable to change, and welcoming of others. Say what you will about such studies and correlation vs. causation, but from our own experience, we know the power that stories and myths, especially in children, have a profound effect on teaching us what and how to think and feel about the world.

The story of the Exodus in Jewish communities and other religious myths in human cultures do the same thing. Religious myths in tribes from Papau New Guinea to Eskimo cultures all teach such values of not wasting, being kind to others, give of your own food, and numerous other social and ethical norms that profoundly shape our feelings and emotions.

My question is, what are the evolutionary mechanisms that drive us to need to tell stories? Simple facts could've been sufficient. It could've been enough to recite Jewish Law, but that wouldn't have had the same impact on these communities as the story of the Exodus does, especially in children.

It is fact that humanity has become taller thanks to natural selection because tall genes were more fit to survive compared to their shorter equivalent.

Generally tall men signals that they're less likely to succumb to diseases this allowed them to use their nutrients which they consumed in order to grow.

Tall men are also more likely to be more intelligent than their shorter counterpart based on the fact they could spend their energy to grow their intelligent instead of falling ill.

Women favour tall men because they're more dominant and stronger than short men. They're more able to protect their tribe properly and thus more likely to survive so that they can protect their offsprings.

By allowing short men to breed we're allowing the inferior gene to spread in human gene pool. However in modern society no genes are favoured because pretty much anybody can survive and spread their genes. This is bad because by allowing short men to breed we're experiencing devolution which means that humanity is becoming shorter, dumber and less strong.

Robert is a journalist who’s written for *The Intercept*, *Wired*, *The Atlantic*, as well as the author of many books on evolution and religion. His most recent book is *Why Buddhism is True*, which gives an evolutionary argument for many of Buddhism’s core ideas. 

Another interesting tidbit, Robert was the author of [The Moral Animal](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Animal-Science-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0679763996), which was one of the three books that Keanue Reeves/Neo had to read while prepping for *the Matrix*!

Here are some recent interviews he did on [“The Wright Show”](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wright-show/id505824847?mt=2) that might be up your alley. I linked to the YouTube videos but these are also all available on the podcast:

* [Does natural selection have a “purpose”?](https://youtu.be/vdTzNVw2oFY) with Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker (just uploaded two days ago) 
* [The evolution of Beauty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSE4S0Hy4VU&amp;) with Yale ornithologist Richard Prum
* [The limits and philosophy of science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn6EXLOO2XU) with philosopher of science and Stoic Massimo Pigliucci.
* [Direction in evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4El3Oi80Mw) with John Maynard Smith. This is an older video, so it’s not on the podcast, however John Maynard Smith is a seminal figure in the history of evolutionary theory due to his application of game theory to the field
* [Science, religious belief, and secularism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPyd2g7JfY&amp;) with historian Peter Harrison, whose work covers religion and the origins of modern science. 

And here are some of the wide-variety of guests Robert has had on his podcast:
* Max Blumenthal - Leftist Journalist, Critic of US Foreign Policy
* Katherine Mangu-Ward - Editor of Libertarian Mag ""Reason""
* David Frum - Neocon, Bush speech writer, Anti Trumper
* Joseph Goldstein - Famous meditation teacher and author of *Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening*
* John McPhee - Famous creative non-fiction Author
* Betsy Levy Paluck - Princeton psychologist
* Richard Vague - Economist
* Ann Hulbert - Literary Editor, Author
* Molly Crockett - Neuroscientist, morality/altruism writer

There’s also a roster of other highly knowledgeable interviewers and interviewees on Robert’s YouTube channels [MeaningOfLife.tv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyXhXAmTRVfeiD8JkWJ7Tzg/featured) and [Bloggingheads.tv](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bloggingheads), which are also stand-alone podcasts. 

Also, Robert taught a course at Princeton that is available through [Coursera: Buddhism and Modern Psychology.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation)

Lastly, for anyone who's interested, Robert recently started a weekly newsletter called [""Mindful Resistance""](https://www.mindfulresistance.net/) which tries to bring the clarity and awareness of mindfulness to how we look at both Trump and the causes/implications of his Presidency without any of the hysterical, tribal and emotional overreactions that are often commonplace.",evolution,1525660250,FaceNibbler,9,29,True,2018-05-06

My first thought is echolocation. Birds being mammals have 3 inner ear bones, leading to more sensitive hearing, whereas birds (being descended from reptiles) have only 1 ear bone. But the problem with this hypothesis of mine is that some birds clearly have amazing sense of hearing, some owls can hear mice underneath the snow from a hundred feet away, so having only one ear bone is clearly not a limitation to the sensitivity of the birds sense of hearing. 

My second thought was the bone structure of the wings. Because bats wings are made up of the finger bones, they have great control over the shape of the wings that birds don’t have. But even so, some birds are tremendously agile. I don’t know of any birds that are as agile as bats (well, humming birds are close to as agile, but they obviously have a niche all they’re own, and their method of flight is just so different from other birds that it’s difficult to make that comparison). I can’t rule this out, but I do feel like it’s not a complete understand or explanation of why birds don’t seem to compete with bats.

78,Evolution of the mind,"I have a question about evolution and our ability to discern truths about our environment. I studied biology in college and lately became interested in reading philosophy. I'm trying to see how the philosophy I'm reading fits in with the biology I've studied. I don't know where to ask this question, but I figure people with a good knowledge of evolution or evolutionary psychology could help me. 

Empiricists claim that all useful knowledge comes from experience (analytic judgments can be made by the mind, but don't add to our knowledge). So all knowledge gained is by experience, and contingent. It is subject to probability and can never be proven with 100% certainty because the next observation could disprove it. Philosopher Immanuel Kant thought that the mind structured the input from the environment, and that there is certain knowledge that adds to our knowledge of the world, but can be discerned independent of experience. He thought this synthetic a priori knowledge was the only type that can give us knowledge of the world. But if the mind evolved, wouldn't that make the structure of the mind due to the environment? Wouldn't any synthetic knowledge or any way the mind categorizes information be a product of evolution and thus actually give us no knowledge independant of experience? Wouldn't any knowledge gained be subject to the same lack of certainty? I know this is probably an odd question, but I figure someone can give me the evolutionary take on the issue.",evolution,1526020574,m_wright92,9,11,True,2018-05-11

Evolution is magic—
How do our brains or life itself evolve to react to different stimuli? Nonetheless, faster, and faster over a long period of time (billions of years).  Gene mutations? How? How does evolution determine what is needed/required for more effective living skills after one/a living thing has died? What is communicating with life on the other end? Saying, ‘oh, well this specifically wasn’t successful, so next time, let’s try this.’? What is telling life it has to change to thrive? There is some sort of equation where a product is communicating with the reactants.  Does anyone have thoughts? Some kind of explanation of hypothesis or theory? I personally believe in energy and transportation of energy even after death,  in the space and earth around the passed, but how does one explain how energy intelligently chooses to learn from a life experience?

10,"Are animal populations held in captivity such as zoos adapting at a genetic level to conditions in captivity? If so, is there potential for such (or are there already) captive animal populations to become semi-domesticated?","I had this question after sitting down and pondering zoos after reading on rapid evolution (guppy experiment and some contemporary life history changes in some animals). 
Specifically since even captive environments may exert selection pressures or conversely a lack thereof, causing population genetic shifts: 

1. Exposing animals to more human contact than they would otherwise. The animals least stressed by human interaction (keepers and crowds) are the ones who will be better at reproducing 

2. Medicine. Take for instance animals whose immune systems are adept to conditions of reduced needs to fighting pathogens and parasites by not being prone to auto-immune conditions or syndromes may be favored. 

3. Other mutant alleles that would normally be removed after some generations are allowed to fix in captive ones because captivity does not provide the same type of generation after generation pressure that natural ones do. 

4. Zoo or other institution size and other environmental constraints. Zoo's and sanctuaries often aren't able say in the case of some species like big cats and birds, to provide sufficient land area appropriate to what would be typical territory sizes or migratory patterns, in combination with human intervention, then how alleles relating to those behaviors vary don't matter much any more allowing (what in the wild would be) mutants to fix in captive populations via drift due to low stock populations in many cases. 

This is a repost and re-rendering of a question I posed to r/ askscience but I haven't really gotten an answer yet. Reddit might not be the place to ask it but I'm 2nd year university student of Biology and am interested. 

Edit: more food for thought to add to the above list of how captive environments are unintentionally selecting traits

Five: Captive Environments are less stimulating overall, favoring organisms who do not experience stress due to a lack of stimulation (smaller brains perhaps over time?) 

Six: Mating. Some zoos are beginning to allow animals to pick their own mates but many programs simply cannot due to a lack of breeding stock. Zoos do not always allow animals to pick their own mates for reasons such as ""preserving genetic diversity"". Sexual selection and mate competition in nature often plays a very strong role in reproduction and in many species only a relatively small percentage of males mate with the majority of females.  Also, the conditions required for mating to even happen are at times not completely known (like in the case of Cheetahs, where early in conservation programs many had issues with even getting the cats to reproduce due to a lack of understanding of proper environments for mating behavior to occur) ",evolution,1522256353,Chibilicious,11,11,True,2018-03-28

Lambda viruses infect bacteria and in order to invade their host cells, like any other virus, they attach themselves to molecular receptors on the surface of cells and for that they need ""unlockers"", host-recognition proteins that sit on the outside of the virus. These unlockers match the receptors on the host's cell, in this case the ones found on bacteria.

Viruses are known they can pretty rapidly adapt to infect other hosts than their normal targets. Bird flu viruses for instances may jump to mammals like humans.

It is known that a single gene sometimes yields multiple different proteins. The lambda virus evolved a protein sequence that was prone to structural instability that results in the creation of at least two different host-recognition proteins. Fortunately for the virus -- but not its host -- these different types of proteins can exploit different locks. Their instability also brings flexibility.

It implies that non-genetic variation in proteins is a way to access more functions from a single DNA gene sequence.",evolution,1522454594,Denisova,8,32,True,2018-03-30

You know that your daughter's kids are genetically yours. You do not have that same assurance with your son's kids, because his wife's children aren't *necessarily* genetically his - his wife may have cheated on him.

Hence, it's normal for parents to value the children of their daughters more highly than the children of their sons. From an evolutionary perspective, it's fair of parents to invest more resources in their daughter's children than their son's children.

More specifically, their daughter's daughter(s) should be more highly valued than their daughter's son(s), because their daughter's daughter(s) provide that assurance for the *next* generation as well. Correct?

1st Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, up legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. (The duplication of “up,” goes unnoticed by the editors.)

2nd  Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, upleg. Last for me, head. Last for me. (The compounding of “up” and “leg,” as well as the deletion of “s” also goes unnoticed by the editors.)

3rd Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, peleg. Last for me, head. Last for me.  (The deletion of “u” and insertion of “e” also go unnoticed by editors.)

It may seem unlikely that this one part would be both so prone to mistakes and so consistently overlooked by the editors, but let us grant the scenario for the sake of argument. 
 
“Peleg,” at this point, could qualify as new information, the proper name of a character whom Santiago is exhorting to “hold up.”  But who is Peleg?  How did he get in the boat?  How will he fit into the overall narrative?  **Microevolution** is the belief that all of the above variations are possible, but that “Peleg” will, sooner rather than later, be edited out.
  
**Macroevolution** is the belief that Peleg could stay, that by the same mechanisms identified above he could become the character Peleg in Herman Melville’s *Moby Dick*, that *The Old Man in the Sea* could itself transform around this character into Melville’s novel (another story about a man hunting a great sea creature) a story with far more information, a different narrative and different characters, all working seamlessly together and giving a remarkable appearance of design.",evolution,1522864619,nomenmeum,61,0,True,2018-04-04

I have a few questions on how survival of the fittest idea fits into evolution. I guess the fundamental question I have is the following:

A person comes endowed with a genetic makeup at birth. Does this genetic makeup change over time in his body? For instance, suppose a person is born to thin and lean parents and hence is also lean for say initial 15 years of his life. Then, the person embarks on a diet and fitness regimen to improve his body posture and muscle mass. Do his genes themselves change from ""thin and lean"" type to ""fit and muscular"" type, say?

Now, when this person procreates around, say, 25 years of age, will the genes that get passed onto his offspring likely to be the ""thin and lean"" type or else the ""fit and muscular"" type?",evolution,1523107225,jahangiram,12,5,True,2018-04-07

50,The easiest way to explain evolution to an evolution denier?,"So I ve had few arguments with evolution deniers and I ve found out that what we think is the best thing in an argument (i.e. evidence) against an evolution denier doesn't work. I think the best way to convince them will be to explain it in a way that it will be obvious to them. The problem is that the people who completely disagree with you (specially when you are scientifically correct) have hardly enough attention span to listen to a detailed explanation. So I wanted to come up with the simplest explanation possible. I am not a biology student. I am a computer science engineering student. But I got interested in evolution after studying genetic alogrithm. So I studied a little bit of biological evolution on my own out of sheer interest and found it fascinating. So according to what I ve learned, this is the easiest explanation I could come up with. Please review if this extremely simplified version is conceptually correct and does not have any misconception, and also please suggest improvement. Keep in mind that it is so simplified that it does not use any technical terms, so that even a person who doesn't have any background in biology can understand. And I want the explanation to be such that after hearing the explanation it will just snap into their brain.

Explanation:-

Evolution will take place in any system which follows these 3 conditions:

1. Copying - A system where stuffs are being copied. (i.e. the process of sexual and asexual reproduction in living organisms)

2. Error or imperfection in copying - The copies should not be exactly the same as parents. There should be variations. (there are slight variations and then there is mutation too)

3. Selection - Some of the variation does better in nature than the others and hence they are naturally selected and their kind of variation survives.

After several iterations of the above 3 steps for a very long time there will obviously be vast changes in organisms. We know that each of the 3 steps are true and happen in nature, so the obvious result of these three steps that we call evolution should also be true. It logically follows.

This dark skin reminds us of his ruggedness, a feature that developed due to being exposed to the scorching sun of africa, made to withstand such an extreme condition. It also has a psychological effect on the observer. The dark skin reminds us of our dark, deep desires that emerge from our primal subconscious past.

The black man's demeanor is one of alphaness. He is dominant, assertive, and can be explosively aggressive. His behaviour strikes fear into the more timid, cowardly races of man.

The summit of expression of his masculinity on his body is his penis. The black penis is largest of all the races. As the penis is the penultimate symbol of manhood, this alone would suffice to make the black man the most masculine of men. This large penis is able fulfill the desire of the neediest of women, being able to more than fill all the recesses of the vagina. Its length ensures that when it ejaculates, the potent african seed will immediately enter the womb of the woman the black man impregnates.

76,Is this idea reasonable about how complexity can emerge without Natural Selection?,"I think complexity does not need Natural Selection, in that at every stage of evolution, there is 50% probability of there being Natural Selection towards complexity, and 50% of stabilizing Natural Selection, which means that half one celled organisms will evolve to more complex organisms, and half will remain unchanged, half of those who evolved to fish will evolve towards higher complexity, while half will remain fish (and evolve to other fish species), what do you think about this idea, doesn't it explain how complexity can emerge as a result of 50% chance and not as a result of natural selection ? 

First, natural selection operates on the level of one celled organisms, but at this stage, there is always an overall 50% chance of these evolutionary processes to proceed towards more complexity, and a 50% chance to remain operating on the same level of complexity.

Thus, half one-celled organisms will evolve to a more complex organism, while half will continue evolving inside the one-celled arena, same for fish towards amphibians, towards reptiles, and mammals and primates...etc.

It does not mean that Natural Selection favours complexity here, it only means that the choice of whether Natural Selection should proceed to the next level of complexity, or to stay on the same level is a 50-50% chance game (it's like genetic drift).

I thought of this comic many years ago, painted it a few years ago, and joined reddit yesterday sooooo here it is! I have way too much to say about it.

TL;DR: you’re a fish

Top and middle panels depict events from ~350 mya. The fish on the left in the top two panels is based on the fossil ray-finned fish *Moythomasia nitida*, from the late Devonian. The fish it's talking to in the first two panels (right) is loosely based on of Tiktaalik (even thogh that dude probs didn't spend much time on land... oh well). The creatures in the background of these top 2 panels are crinoids and a trilobite, which were both very prevalent in the Devonian. The bottom panel has all extant animals: a striped bass, a dolphin, a crab, and an urchin. The leftmost fishes were depicted as having the same pattern to give continuity to their lineage (ray-finned fishes), although we obviously have little idea as to the colors and patterns that extinct fishes exhibited. I didn't color the lobe-finned fishes (Tiktaalik and dolphin) exactly the same, but I think it makes enough sense. I hope.

123,Horizontal gene transfer as evolutionary force in microbes,"Found an interesting article regarding evolution. It is a few months old, so it is possible it has been published earlier:

""My graduate student Hong-Yan Shih and I modeled the ecosystem of an organism called Prochlorococcus, a type of cyanobacteria that lives in the ocean through photosynthesis. I think it may well be the most numerous cellular organism on the planet. There are viruses, called phages, that prey on the bacteria. Ten years or so ago, it was discovered that these phages have photosynthesis genes, too. Now, you normally wouldn’t think of a virus as needing to do photosynthesis. So why are they carrying these genes around? 

It seems that the bacteria and phages don’t quite behave as the dynamics of a predator-prey ecosystem would predict. The bacteria actually benefit from the phages. In fact, the bacteria could prevent the phages from attacking them in many ways, but they don’t, not entirely. The phages’ photosynthesis genes originally came from the bacteria — and, amazingly, the phages then transferred them back to the bacteria. Photosynthesis genes have shuttled back and forth between the bacteria and the phages several times over the last 150 million years. 

It turns out that genes evolve much more rapidly in the viruses than they do in the bacteria, because the replication process for the viruses is much shorter and more likely to make mistakes. As a side effect of the phages’ predation on the bacteria, bacterial genes sometimes get transferred into the viruses, where they can spread, evolve quickly and then be given back to the bacteria, which can then reap the benefits. So the phages have been useful to the bacteria. For example, there are two strains of Prochlorococcus, which live at different depths. One of those ecotypes adapted to live closer to the surface, where the light is much more intense and has a different frequency. That adaptation could occur because the viruses made rapid evolution available. 

And the viruses benefit from the genes, too. When a virus infects its host and replicates, the number of new viruses it makes depends on how long the hijacked cell can survive. If the virus carries with it a life-support system — the photosynthesis genes — it can keep the cell alive longer to make more copies of the virus. The virus that carries the photosynthesis genes has a competitive advantage over one that doesn’t. There’s a selection pressure on the viruses to carry genes that benefit the host. You’d expect that because the viruses have such a high mutation rate, their genes would deteriorate rapidly. But in the calculations that we’ve done, we’ve found that the bacteria filter the good genes and transfer them to the viruses.""

Link: https://www.quantamagazine.org/seeing-emergent-physics-behind-evolution-20170831/

No reason to assume this is restricted to cyanobacteria only. It is probably happening all over the microbial world. Using viruses as ""errand boys"", the evolution of certain genes can occur a lot faster and spread to others of its kind on a much shorter amount of time than if they only had to rely on themselves. 

It's like a microbe tells the virus; here is a gene, now make more versions of it and we will pick the best one and pass it around to others.

Why not more often amongst higher organisms? From the same article: 

""Tommaso Biancalani and I discovered in the last year or so that life automatically shuts off the horizontal gene transfer once it has evolved enough complexity.

Another scenario involving regular oscillations in environmental conditions would be species adapted to monsoon/dry seasons.

One thing that kind of comes to mind are cicada life cycles and their emergence after 13 or 17 years and the idea of biological or molecular clocks.

It’d be really cool to see these adaptations so rigidly established by the constant cyclical nature of the species’ environments that if there were an unusually long or short “season” the adaptations become entirely disadvantageous. Sort of like what happens when some cicadas emerge prematurely.

I can imagine the mother being selective about (among other things) penis morphology, and then allowing the suppression of her lineage's penis morphology genes, on average improving her overall fitness.


On the other hand, the same thing might have occurred for her lineage's genes, making, say, her father's penis morphology the more fit.


On the THIRD hand, it could just be normal all inheritance and selection acting on the autosomes.

Sex and evolution are inextricably intertwined, and it shouldnt be surprising that the morphology of the male instrument by which the process is made possible is under significant sexual selection. http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6925

67,The evolution of insects,"Some thoughts and speculations about insect evolution and how they evolved wings.

Just read an article on the net: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180123235133.htm

It says: ""Being the first and only animals able to fly would have been extremely powerful. Flight allowed insects to explore new ecological niches and provided new means of escape. ""All of a sudden, your abundance can increase because you can just get away from your predators so much more easily,"" Schachat said. ""You can also eat the leaves that are at the top of a tree without having to walk up the entire tree.""

Flying insects could also create niches that didn't exist before. ""Imagine an omnivorous insect that flies to the top of trees to feed,"" Schachat said. ""Suddenly, there's a niche for a predator that can fly to the top of the tree to eat that insect. Wings allowed insects to expand the suite of niches that can be filled. It really was revolutionary.""

***

In the early days insects were mostly detritivores and decomposers, and some were probably carnivorous. There were few if any herbivores. From another article: ""Although insects that sucked plant juices evolved earlier, few insects were actually eating live plants before the Late Carboniferous, by which time stem-boring and gall-making insects had also appeared. By the Permian, however, insects had evolved an abundance of effective herbivores."" 

(The first cooperation between plants and animals seems to be at least 280 million years old: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180301144127.htm, but winged insects has existed much longer than that)

Therefore it doesn't seem likely they used their wings to be able to fly to the top of the early forests to gorge on vegetables before much later. 

The far most abundant winged insects were once primitive cockroaches and their relatives. In these ancient forests they made up the majority of insects species. I think some soruce says more than 90% of all insects known from that period. And they mostly lived like their ancestors, as detritivores and decomposers. Even today there are not that many insect orders that are specialized herbivores. 

All the most primitive insect orders where their nymphal stage is specialized for an aquatic existence, except for dragonflies and damselflies, have the same diet where they feed on detritus, decomposing organic matter and microorganisms. (And the aquatic stage appears to be a secondary trait since the gills are an adaptation of the trachea system, and because all the gills has a different origin from one another. The only gills that truly resemble wings is the mayfly gills.) Archaeognatha and Thysanura, bristletials and silverfish, are as we know even older and are fully terrestrial. 

Cockroaches and insects with a similar lifestyle seems to have used their wings mainly for colonizing new areas. How many insects are using their wings to avoid predators today? Mostly the most advanced orders like flies, wasps and butterflies, which did not exist back then. Grasshoppers use their legs to escape (combined with their wings to glide away), but the earliest winged insects were not specialized jumpers, even if some of the wingless bristletails have their own jumping technique, so they would probably prefer to either run or defend themselves if possible.

Others, like mayflies, used their wings to make swarms when mating. Way too many appearing at once to affect the numbers of individuals that survived attacks from predators. 

The air in those days were terrorized by dragonflies and similar insects, and would probably not be much safer than living on the ground. It made you exposed and an easy picking for these flying carnivores that were the first true masters of the air. Before the first flying vertebrates evolved, they were the dominating flying predators on the planet, just as spiders, scorpions and centipedes were the dominating ground dwelling predators before the vertebrates conquered land. 

If you look at how dragonflies live, they spend most of their life in water, and then they one day takes to the air. It obviously does not show how wings evolved since it must have happened much more gradually. It is unlikley that an aquatic species evolved wings when this trait would have been useless for its whole life except when it was time to reproduce. The selection pressure for growing wings must therefor have been restricted to its final stage in life if that was true, but wings starts to develope way earlier than that in insects with incomplete metamorphosis (and insects with complete metamorphosis did not yet exist).

So how did insects evolve their wings, what kind of selection pressure was involved? There are yet no clear evidence for how it happened, but you can say one thing for sure; it happened in a time when the air was completely safe due to lack of both cobwebs and flying predators. Every moment in air would have been a moment in safety, no matter what waited on the ground.

The first forests offered new niches to be occupied. The first trees, or tree like plants, would have trunks where other organisms could grow, like fungus, lichen and a film of mikroorganisms. Especially dead trees where much of the trunk was still standing. A once mostly horisontal ecosystem would gradually create a vertical niche as the plants became taller and bigger.
Primitive insects, and probably other arthropods, that were feeding on what was growing in these trunks would occupy these niches, and predators would follow. 
One way to protect themself is what many animals still do today; they drop from branches and trunks and falls into safety. Crabs, snakes, mammals, ants, frogs, spiders, millipedes, nestlings and others animals do it. They hit the ground or the water, and have avoided the danger for now. Some even glide to make the landing less hard, or they land on another trunk. The first step to control their escape and where they land. 
 
It is pretty likely that some of the early arthropods, more than just one species, used the same solution. And gradually they became even better to control their time in air, to make it last longer and avoiding obstacles, which required faster reactions and better sight. But there would be no true arms race for dominance in the air. That only happened when one or more of the gliding arthropods started to eat their smaller gliding and non-gliding relatives. When it happened is hard to say. But it did happen, and the air was no longer safe. These predators could even spot a prey on another trunk and glide over and grab it before it had time to escape.

When the first gliding predators started to hunt for gliding prey, who took to the air to escape, it would inscrease the selection pressure for navigation, speed and extended time in air, eventually leading to true powered flight. And when that happened, the ancestors of dragonflies and their relatives would be the first animals who used their wings to occupy a new niche. Others would use their wings for other purposes like finding a mate or a new living area. Otherwise they would mostly still use their feet as their main way of locomotion. 
 
Another well known fact about dragonflies; the male use secondary genitals to mate. Just like spiders and some other animals do. Species with internal fertlization is picking up the male sperm in three ways; the male place a spermatophore outside its own body where it is picked up by the female. Or a part of the male body picks it up first and injects it into the female. Or the sperm goes directly from inside the male to inside the female. 
But has it ever happened in the animal kingdom that a species where the male first pick up its own package of sperm and deliver it to the female with secondary genitals has evolved direct fertlization through primary genitals? Or that species with primary genitals have evolved secondary genitals for some reason? 
If no, it means that the common ancestor of dragonflies and all other insects with wings must have still used spermatophores that were picked up by the female outside the male's body. And that male genitals used for copulation evolved at least twice in flying insects (possibly three if mayflies are more closely related to dragonflies than other insects). The question is if it happened before or after the origin of flight. If it happened before, it means that insect wings evolved twice. Or they could have split at a stage where primitive wings had already evolved, but still no true flight.

No matter the reason. If they hadn't evolved wings, insects today would probably still be just a minor part of the terrestrial arthropod fauna.",evolution,1520789157,Tidemand,1,15,True,2018-03-11

84,"Can ""degree of variability"" be selected for by evolution?","It's easy to see how a trait like height can be encoded in DNA and thus optimized for an environment through natural selection. But imagine 2 populations of a species. In population A, offspring have a low degree of variation from their parents: fewer mutations, smaller degrees of change. In the population B, the offspring are more varied.

You could say that pop A employs a ""conservative"" strategy to survival, and pop B employs a more ""experimental"" strategy. B would have a lot more unsuccessful offspring, but could potentially adapt better in a rapidly changing environment. A's strategy is better during periods of stability.

Is this ""degree of variability"" something that can actually be encoded in our DNA and thus selected for? If so, what is this concept called and how does it work?",evolution,1521047299,throwaway24515,10,4,True,2018-03-14

I used to be super religious when I was younger, but over the years I've done research and started believing in things like evolution and started dismissing the bible more and more. Today in class, responding to something I had written in a philosophy paper we did, she tried to prove the flood happened. Normally I wouldn't give a shit, I mean I can't judge since I used to think that way, but she started getting weird. She started doing a lesson that was attempting to prove Noah's flood. She only did it because I wrote about how I didn't believe it, in a paper we did, and threw some reasons as to why I didn't at her (respectfully though haha). One thing I said was ""Fossil layers from different time periods don't overlap. Meaning, we don't find dinosaur bones mixed in with human bones. However, she argued that we do in fact see dinosaur bones overlap with human bones. She gave no examples, but she wrote some side notes on my paper telling me to do my research and saying I'm wrong. She also told me to look at both christian articles and secular articles, when literally every christian article I read agreed that they don't overlap and they give somewhat okay reasons as to why. (although the articles said it was possible for them to overlap, they just happened not to. At least they gave reasons though, unlike my teacher.) 

She also said to the class, knowing that I and a few others don't believe in it, she said not believing the flood happened was stupid and foolish. She didn't necessarily corner me directly, but everyone in there basically already knows I don't believe like them so it was pretty awkward. And I was thinking, imagine if the roles were switched. Imagine if a religious student went into science class, and the teacher did everything they could to try and make the religious student look wrong. And when the student tried to make points, the teacher answered them rudely in an attempt to make them look dumb (Like she did with me). The religious community that student belonged to would go ballistic if they heard that. 

I'm not saying this issue is all that serious, because I really couldn't give a single crap, but it is just really annoying. When I asked how did kangaroos get to Australia without us finding any fossils in between the middle east (where the ark supposedly landed) and Australia, she said they swam. And everyone agreed with her. How fucking ludicrous. She had some explanation about Pangea allowing them to get there, even though she said Pangea split up during the flood.

In addition, as a proof that the term ""evolution"" is basically a bastardized term, evolution is considered as a theory and a fact ... this is a logical breach in the scientific sense ... a theory cannot be a fact, or vice versa ... for example, miasma is a fact, disease is a fact : however, miasma theory of disease is not a fact ... miasma is not a theory, disease is not a theory, miasma theory of disease is a theory ... Now imagine miasma being a fact and a theory ... this means that the obsolete and incorrect miasma theory of disease is also a fact ... this is twisted logic ... but this is very similar to evolution ... with this logic you can never tackle evolution ... because it gets switched back and forth : changing factual validity from fact to theory to suit the argument ... this is the primary reason why evolution theory hasn't been debunked ...

When I have read about molecular convergence, the literature seems to use 'parallel' and 'convergent' evolution terms interchangeably when talking about the evolution of both domestication traits as well as domestication genes, however I know they both mean different things.

Essentially what I am confused over is this: is the occurrence of shared phenotypes between related (even distantly related) plant species always a result of parallel selection or would it ever be as a result of convergent evolution? 

I.e. in an example I use: Sorghum and Maize diverged 11.9mya. But under domestication (around 10,000 years ago) both species' adopted similar domesticated phenotypes. Their common ancestor DID NOT have these domesticated phenotypes that both Sorghum and Maize independently evolved (suggesting convergent evolution) but DID have the genes that led to these traits that were then selected for by both Sorghum and Maize (suggesting parallel selection). So did these traits evolve under convergent or parallel evolution?

Homo sapiens sapiens are a relatively young species. The role of neotony in human evolution is significant. That is, changes in developmental rates have occurred as modern humans evolved from hominid ancestors. 

Neotony can lead to speciation - a juvenile stage of development becomes an adult form. Are modern humans in evolutionary transition?

Is precocious puberty considered a change in rate of development? Does it have an effect on critical periods of development? It seems to be increasing and becoming more widespread. Becoming a concern in Japan. Should we be concerned about a shift in human developmental rates? The human growth spurt occurs because the brain is increasing in size throughout puberty. If puberty is occurring 6-8 years earlier than it was a hundred years ago, would that not have a significant effect on brain development? 

""Today most doctors accept that the age of onset of puberty is dropping steadily. Many studies have showed this to be the case for girls, and new research carried out by Herman-Giddens, and published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, has found the same for boys. The age of onset of biological adulthood continues to plunge. Consider the statistics provided by German researchers. They found that in 1860, the average age of the onset of puberty in girls was 16.6 years. In 1920, it was 14.6; in 1950, 13.1; 1980, 12.5; and in 2010, it had dropped to 10.5.

Update: To express the full implications of what I am suggesting I will include a question I ask in another post.

As we look out into the universe we wonder if we are alone. We wonder if there are other intelligent beings, with knowledge and technology. Yet human like intelligence may not be a trait favored by evolution. Human intelligence and its technological offshoots, has created a world with ever increasing threats to our survival as a species. It has reached the point where we are considering living on other planets, as our world becomes less hospitable. Maybe we have found no signs of human like intelligence because it is an evolutionary dead end. (There are many examples of animal intelligence, in many cases rivaling mans own, that do not produce the environmental disruption of human activity.)

While I don't share such strong sentiments, I must admit they are quite adaptionalist in their approach to evolution. It makes me wonder whether they're aware of the ""Spandrels of San Marco"", or the works of Kimuraa and Ohta (near neutral theory) and some of the current work by people like Eugene Koonin or William Martin. 


If the adaptationalist are teaching new generations of biologist their biased POV, will they not also be biased in the way they view their own research in the diverse field of biology (which are all unified by theory of evolution)?

12,Am I An Animal?,"The first person I ever knew with a cell phone was some kid in grade school in 1996. I remember he brought it to class and was showing it off. I remember it was this flip phone monstrosity with a leather case and a kevlar grade plastic screen. He promptly had it taken away until the end of the day.
 
    The first phone call was made in 1876. It was made from one phone to another phone. I can only imagine it was some whirling, buzzing mess of engineering. Did that kid, 121 years later, bring a phone to school? Or, was it something else? At some point, it went from being a whirling, buzzing mess to something that could fit in your pocket.

    I haven’t had a phone in 15 years. I rented an apartment with my best friend, and as was the custom at the time I hauled my massive landline with me, phone cable in tow. I was a relatively late bloomer in the cell phone game, getting one around the same time. I was also late getting a smartphone, just about four years ago. 

    These aren’t phones anymore. These are computers. They became computers about nine years ago. We still call them phones. But they are not. In every single sense the current smartphone is an advancement over its predecessor. It would be utterly ascine to utter the words “they are not better than each other, they are equals, different but equal”. 

    Humans are the only animals that are self-aware, that have a mind. We are aware of our lifespan. At one point it was not like this. Just like one day phones became computers, at some point humans ceased being animals. I do not know what we are. But we are not animals. We have become something else.

    At some point a bajillion years ago something crawled out of the sea and would eventually become a reptile. At some point mammals branched off from reptiles. In every way, shape, and form mammals have been more successful at expanding, replicating, and populating their habitat. Simply put, mammals are better at doing what an animal is supposed to do: reproduce. Replicate. Dominate its environment. Most importantly, survival. 

    A mammal is a more advanced model than a reptile. A mammal is flip phone. A reptile is a whirling, buzzing monstrosity. And a human? A Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. 

    We’re not quite sure where conscious came from. We are, after all, made up of the exact same cells that are in a horse. The cells in our brains somehow arranged themselves in a fashion that make self-awareness possible. Obviously, this is mind bogglingly rare. There are currently 10’s of thousands of species on this planet right now (and possibly 100’s of thousands that have come and gone) and not a single one, never once, knew that it would die.               

     I don’t think this is true, I KNOW it’s true: we are the only intelligent life in this universe. I also know this to be true: there are thousands, or even millions of planets out there, beautiful pristine places, with bears, and fish, and deer, and frogs. Not a single one of them has a creature like us. We are...alone.
    
    Humans have no “duty” to save anything. We are to use (and use up) this planet as we see fit. We should only care about global warming if we believe it negatively impacts our species. We should only save elephants if we believe losing them negatively impacts our species. We should only clean up our oceans if we believe that polluted oceans negatively impacts our species. 

    I’m proud of being human. There’s all kinds of research that suggests that the reason we are so successful as a species is because of our incredible capacity for sociability. We share. We’re civil. Experiment after experiment has shown babies sharing food with other babies. Babies as young as six months already show signs of sociability, being drawn to people that they perceive to be more civil. 

    We are God. I mean that with the utmost sincerity. We ceased being animals and became God. “The creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being”. The creator of the universe: nothing exists until it is observed, and nothing has ever observed the universe before. Thusly, this makes us the ruler of the universe. And, since we are the only self-aware species in the universe, we are quite literally “the supreme being”.

    Some people will have you believe that there is more war and famine. There is not. We have never experienced more peace and prosperity. Some people will have you believe we are running out of oil. We are not. We will never run out of oil. Some people will have you believe that there is more crime. There is not. We have never been more civil. As a species we are just fine. And this planet is just fine, too.

14,Why is every irreducible trait assumed to arise from a useful progenitor?,"As long as traits are not deleterious, selection shouldn't be able to weed them out. Yet on their own, they can eventually assume a useful function - through sheer chance!

For example check out the following:
http://www.cell.com/cell/references/S0092-8674(17)31504-0

An early viral invasion inserted an ""HIV-like GAG gene"" into the mammalian genomes and this was eventually co-opted as a useful RNA-packaging protein for the host. Every step in the evolution of traits need not be useful, as long as they're not too deleterious, they can persist in the population and can be eventually become the subject of positive selection if they acquire a function that is bveneficial to the host. Edit: In this case, viral invasion and insertion of genetic material is not useful for the organism. 


Why do we not consider other traits to evolve in a similar fashion? Some of the explanations I hear for the evolution of traits via this ""every step is useful"" fashion are far-fetched (however, some are quite good - and are strongly empirically backed!). Nevertheless, evolution isn't intelligent design - useful traits are allowed to arise through mal-adaptive processes.

But there is a serious question hanging in my mind: Our ancestors that were just as intelligent as other animals were roughly living around 4 million years age; by assuming average life of every organisms in the generation spring from them to us be equal to 25 years, I reach to approximate number of 160,000 generations. Now, It becomes hard for me to grasp how all the complexities related to human mind (i.e. consciousness, language, morals, creativity, etc.) have developed through random immutations through this number of generations.

16,I'm trying to make a good analogy of life on earth for someone. Is this an accurate way to put it?,"There are no hard-lines in biology. I’ve used the analogy of the color spectrum before which helps illustrate the way life seamlessly branches out over time. Think about how we make distinctions between colors like red and blue, yet we can’t point out where one ends and the next begins due to the “intermediate” shades between them. There is no real division where red turns to blue; just a gradient. What we really have is a seamless wave of color that we arbitrarily divide into different parts. 

Life is similar. If we were to resurrect everything that has ever lived on this planet and set it all out chronologically, we couldn't point to where one species began and the next ended due to the “intermediate” shades of life between them. Just like the color spectrum; what we really have is a seamless wave of life that we arbitrarily divide and label. Species are not immutable categories that are simply born a certain way. Their change over time extends their branch of the spectrum as it goes. 

It's all part of one blossoming continuum of evolving matter. Everything from the T-rex to tree moss is connected by bridges of extinct life forms before and ahead of them, beautiful and fluid.

17,A question related to sexual selection in humans,"I wrote the following to someone about a week ago:

&gt;There's a commonly cited idea [about the human species] that in the ancestral environment, only around 40% of the males around at any given time were able to reproduce, while over 80% of females were able to. The obvious implication is that the highest status males got multiple females, while the lowest status males got nothing. Although cruel from a modern perspective, this is an ingenious system for increasing the power of the evolutionary process: When a man is born, his genes operate under the assumption that he will *probably not be able to reproduce*, and thus a certain degree of risk is required. If the buzzer is about to go off and you're on the other side of the basketball court, you don't just decide to not shoot because you're taking a low-percentage shot; you take the Hail Mary because it's all you have. This explains why men tend to have significantly lower risk aversion than women, and also why men tend to have greater genetic variation in, for example, IQ. Woman are born more average, and are the *selectors*; men are born more extreme in one way or another and are the *selected*. Every new generation of men give the women an opportunity to pick the men whose genes took a chance and succeeded, and let the failures fall out of the gene pool. This allows for much more risky variation in genetic output (and behavioral patterns), while systematically picking only the risks which happened to work out. With greater leaps of adaptation activated, and the excesses expertly removed from the gene pool at each iteration, the process of adaptation to environmental conditions is greatly accelerated. This [may be part of the explanation for] why dimorphic life is so common; sexual selection is a brilliant meta-adaptation: an adaptation at the level of adaptation itself.

22,"Possible connection between human and hyena ""laughter""","Humans laugh.  Hyenas laugh.  But we do it for opposite reasons - humans to relieve stress, hyenas when fleeing from danger- so this is generally thought to be a coincidence.

However, we both evolved on the African plains, with a similar social scavenger-predator-kleptoparasite niche.  It seems likely that we were in competition often, so maybe it's not that we evolved the same sound for similar reasons (unlikely), but to mimic each other.

The sound of a fleeing hyena would be reason for humans to relax.  Maybe we (or some earlier primate ancestor) associated the sound with relief and then repurposed it for social behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the human sound came first and hyenas started to mimic it because it's a good way of getting a pack of humans to relax after they have chased the hyena away from a kill.

I’d like to speak with people with a good understanding of intelligent design creationism and Darwinian evolution, as I believe knowing just one theory is an extreme bias, feel free to comment but please be mindful of what you don’t know about the other theory if you do only know one very well. This is actually my first new post on Reddit, as I was discussing this on YouTube for a few weeks and got banned for life for conversing about this, but that was before I really came to a conclusion for myself, at this point I’d say I’m split just about the same as if I didn’t know either theory, and since I am a Christian, creationism makes more sense to me personally, and in order to believe we were evolved naturally very good proof that can stand on its own is needed to treat darwinian evolution as fact the way an atheist does. 

Also for clarity, Evolution here means the entire theory of Darwinian evolution as taught from molecules to man naturally, intelligent design will mean the theory represented by the book “of pandas an people” and creationism will refer to the idea God created things as told in the Bible somehow. I value logic, and I will point out any fallacies in logic I see, don’t take it personally when I do because I refuse to allow fallacy persist as a way for evolutionists to convince people their “story” is correct.

25,Given that evolution is obviously a fact how do people still think it is a fairy tale?,"I know the correct definition for evolution is that it is a scientific theory to explain that there will be a change in allele frequency over time in a given population.  This simply indicates the obvious that as new life arises and old life dies the new life will not be an exact copy of the old life. There are connected theories of evolution that explain the HOW of evolution which are also basically facts in the colloquial sense of the word fact also called ____ theory of evolution.. You can put in a number of words into that blank and many would be mostly accurate like Darwinian evolution, evolution via natural selection, evolution due to sexual reproduction, evolution due to genetic drift. 

Basically all of the minor theories lead to the greater theory that many factors lead to an organism surviving and reproducing and leaving evidence that they even existed yet all evidence used points to evolution happening regardless of the understanding of what evolution is.

Some people admit to micro evolution or adaption which is just evolution on a short time scale but they have trouble connecting that to reality and longer time frames such that small changes stack up.. humans have had their pinky fingers gradually getting shorter as a whole I believe is one thing I read.

I don't know if that is accurate myself but if it is then you can test that and proves that our pinky fingers may have been longer in the past ... this is one type of testing done in modern still living organisms to determine what to look for in the past. DNA molecular clock or the rate of change DNA goes through over time across successive generations can show where to find the ancestor fossils we have found in the fossil record. The entire classification of life is based on evolution and was mostly based on evolution even before it was corrected for accuracy. 

The only other theories are known as the ""god did it"" and ""it is not even real but we live in a simulation"". In these ideas I mean theory as guess because there is little to know scientific evidence to even qualify as a testable hypotheses yet evolution which has been tested is proven to happen as expected and even predicts stuff to be true even before they are proven in another way.  

The argument that people generally accept evolution as fact and then ""make the evidence fit"" might happen a lot more now but that's only because evolution has been proven true time and time again and to move further in science you used proven tested theories to make discoveries and only when something doesn't seem to match you test the theory. These same people say they are not creationists and open to other ideas yet they feel a book written in 700 bc about a god that never existed based on what people thought was true 2700 years ago has more logic in it then science and base their starting point on disproven ideas to come to illogical conclusions.

I am looking for reasons based theologically, philosophically, scientifically, and any reason that could explain this to me. I can't even find a reason to deny the obvious even if they believe their god made everything because the first people to propose evolution from one species to another and millions of years were bible thumping christians.

34,Due to the obvious misunderstanding by creationists,"The way that Science works:
&amp;nbsp;
Notice something (make an observation)
&amp;nbsp;
Come up with some ideas
&amp;nbsp;
Decide what ideas you can test and form a hypothesis  (a testable guess.. typically linked to what types of results will prove it true and what will prove it false)
&amp;nbsp;
Use math or expiramentation (usually expiraments) to confirm or deny what your hypothesis was, when you prove yourself wrong form a new hypothesis and repeat the expirament/confirmation step
&amp;nbsp;
Once you are satisfied create a theory and allow other scientists to confirm your theory or prove it wrong and create better theories.


When it comes to evolution the word is misused and misunderstood. The definition is a change in allele frequency over time (or not everything clones everything that it descended from without changes).. This observation is called hereditary differences or adaption but people don't realize they are just using different words to describe observed evolution.

The overall theory of evolution is that this has been going on as far back as can be observed, everything is related and through evolution early life evolved into the life we have today. It doesn't apply to changes that happen before life existed though some proto-life did evolve. It does not apply to inorganic molecules and the big bang theory or abiogenesis. This CAN be proven wrong but HAS NOT been proven wrong. This is what makes it a theory. At least one scientist tested a hypothesis or a series of hypothesis and arose at the conclusion that all life must be related arising from a single common ancestor through evolution and then since every non-biased expiramentation and observation by everyone else since failed to disprove it the theory is still held in almost as high of a regard as 2 + 2 = 4.. It remains possible to disprove evolution but nobody has.

There are other theories of how evolution works and they are all tested with the premise that evolution happens explaining *how* we got from point A to point T and every point in between and every point after is hypothesized based on the theory. When new theories of how evolution happens a grand overall theory including all the proven mechanisms is considered the theory of evolution.

The ""fact"" remains that evolution happens

The 1st theory is that we are all related to every other form of life that does and will ever exist

The 2nd theory is how evolution happens

These theories are combined simply as a single theory of evolution and no limitations to what could eventually form or the amount of time it could have happened in the past have been imposed and were always debunked by anyone who attempted to impose them.

42,Personal theory on how widely used contraception by humans alters their evolution.,"I have been reading The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins and thought about this during The Battle of the Sexes chapter.

Previously, a male human, in order to more effeciently pass on his genes, might be inclined to be more promiscuous. Genes promoting promiscuous instincts would spread in the gene pool.

With the widespread use of contraception, promiscuous males might be more inclined to use it, whereas monogamous males would be less inclined to use it. Therefore, genes promoting monogamous instincts in males would start to become more numerous and monogamy would become more common in the future.

Assumptions: 
1. a future where access to contraception and abortion is available to all.
2. A sexually liberated society where the choice between monogamy and promiscuity is more easily made. The choices would then be more driven by instinct then by societal pressures.

I definitely understand that this isn't the most original theory but I am still interested in others' thoughts on it.

Edit: i thought of this while reading about male behaviour. After thinking about it more i realize that it could equally apply to females' promiscuous vs monogamous instincts.

52,It is amazing how the simplest adaptions led to great complexity.,"The very basic start to some of the most complex features could be as simple as surface chemical receptors already present in bacteria. Others from cells in simple multicellar organisms with primitive sensors or from cilia on single cells.

While not exactly understood every single possible first mutation it seems even the most basic adaptions were usually helpful. Chemical ion receptors in bacteria and slightly more advanced related receptors in other single celled organisms leading to nerve cells, light receptors, touch receptors. These are the very simple beginnings to neurons, sight, touch, taste, smell. Very gradual advances leading to brains, eyes, gills, skin, digestive systems, circulatory systems.. sometimes other tiny changes leading to very basic lungs, nostrils, jaws, ears, stomachs, intestines, bladders, fins. Gradually as things already existed they would get better in some cases when they were needed or lost altogether when not required. 

When it comes to brains the simple chemical receptors that existed since bacteria and pores between connected cells and chemical transmitters allowing a simple brain able to learn and remember or handle the basic functions required to stay alive. These are the oldest parts of the brain seen in fish and reptiles.. the ability to breathe, eat, see, move, and use basic instincts to survive. At some point brains began developing in 3 cell layers with one layer leading to the brain stem, another leading to the limbic system, and another leading to the cerebrum and the cortex. In humans the cortex and frontal lobe cells create far more neurons during development allowing us to do enough to allow us to have a consciousness and do far more than what is needed to just survive like ponder our existence, use complex speech, and pass down our knowledge or religious beliefs to our descendants.

The human brain is one such thing that some people think can't be caused by evolution yet the development of something like the brain is just a more advanced version of each step that came before it. Eating cooked meat and walking on two legs allowed us to obtain the nutrition and move fast enough to keep our big brains without it being a burden. Some animals have larger brains than us but have fewer neurons such as whales... though whales are still quite intelligent. In primates our brain is about 7 times as complex for its size as most primate brains though leading to the theory it was because of eating cooked meat and those with bigger brains and therefor more intelligence living in bigger societies  passing down information was a bigger advantage than it was to have a small brain and live away from society. Both of these features we evolved or began doing together so they may be related or just coincidence but in the wild most animals that don't evolve as much complexity don't get as much benefit from it or get enough nutrition to feed it. Our human brain consumes about 20% of the calories we eat. In some animals that much of their food going to feed their brain might starve their bodies thus those with smaller brains would survive longer. We have a bunch of things going for us allowing us to have big brains and survive and since our brains did get complex our complex brains allowed us to adapt with intelligence and technology when our bodies couldn't survive without it.  Sometimes animals are small allowing them to survive not leaving as much space for a big brain and sometimes their brains are just fine and wouldn't help much with more complexity.. a dolphin as smart as it is wouldn't need to have any ability to use a computer or draw a picture in their brains as their bodies are not capable. Yet they do have a lot of complexity in their brains compared to other animals. They can be trained, they are capable of social behavior, capable of empathy. These are helpful for the survival of dolphins but surfing the web wouldn't be a thing a dolphin would need in their daily life and their brains wouldn't stack up adaptions allowing that as any adaptions towards that would not be necessary enough to be selected for and so many more wouldn't have anything like that.",evolution,1515688939,ursisterstoy,2,8,True,2018-01-11

78,In general a loss is twice as painful as a gain is pleasurable. How did this psychological loss avoidance evolve in humans?,"I've read about certain heuristics that have evolved in humans. There is a breast-hip-waist measurement ratio in women that tends to be most optimal for fertility. In studies the average breast-hip-waist measurement men found most attractive in women turns out to be the same measurement that tends to be optimal for fertility. All this makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective, because males in general have been hardwired by evolution to be attracted to what makes successful reproduction most likely.

Evolution wired a heuristic into males brains to allow for a way to quickly assess the likelihood of reproduction based on a women's curves. I'll refrain from anthropomorphizing evolution by thanking it for that here.

Not directly related to that, I've recently been learning about loss aversion. Psychological studies have shown that overall, people will avoid a loss, rather than attempt to achieve a gain. The studies have shown that in general a loss is experienced as twice as painful as a gain is pleasurable.

An interesting talk on loss aversion here:
[Board Game Design and the Psychology of Loss Aversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_1YcCcBVfY&amp;t=2681s)

So it turns out there are many examples where this highly sensitive loss aversion causes problems. People will forego a gain that when analyzed more closely is obviously better, in order to avoid a minimal loss.

It would seem to me that just like evolution has tweaked the female measurement ratio heuristic in men, evolution has probably been tweaking this loss aversion to gain ratio gut reaction heuristic in humans as well. If that is the case, and the loss aversion set by the heuristic when looked at more closely seems to be set far too sensitive, how and why did it evolve this way? And if evolution did tweak the loss aversion, is it something that we should try to overcome, especially when further analysis seems to show how incorrect the default gut reaction heuristic we've been hardwired with is?

Again take a look at the linked video to get some insight into the loss aversion I'm describing here. To boil it down, if the loss aversion is an evolved gut reaction heuristic, why did it evolve in an apparently unbalanced way as closer analysis seems to show? Anyone have any ideas?

85,Random Occurrences in Natural Selection,"Hi all,

So, I'm in the middle of reading The Origin of Species, in the chapter on natural selection, and I'm a little curious about something.  This isn't a pointed question, instead it's more me thinking out loud (into the internet).  Darwin emphasizes the minute attention to detail that the impersonal mechanism of natural selection naturally exercises, of course selecting for traits which are most advantageous in any given environment at any given time.  I wonder though, what role did Darwin allot for random chance occurrences, either fortuitous or not?  That might be something he answers in later chapters, in which case I will have answered my own question.  If not, though, does current evolutionary theory take any interest in the value of random occurrences?  

I think, on considering an example which I've retracted now, that I might have fallen into the common error of anthropomorphizing natural selection, turning it into a subtly personal agent rather than a truly impersonal process, because I expect it to somehow account for bad or good luck, when actually it has to do neither.  Things simply occur (an asteroid strike, for example), and then natural selection acts upon what remains.  Very interesting.   ",evolution,1516429040,creslin_black,8,0,True,2018-01-20

89,Strawberries have been artificially selected for centuries.,"After most recently eating a nice bowl of strawberries from my dorm fridge, an odd thought arrived to me. Why do all the strawberries in my bowl look so red and similar in size? I went on to look into the internet to find my answer.

Turns out strawberries have been around for centuries but not for what people think. Often enough their flowers actually held the attention of most consumers and had ornamental value amongst royalty. Over time more and more species were found, mostly varieties of the Fragaria Vesca species. Such species were great for their large abundance of produce. They also had great medicinal value in their leaves.

America would first start breeding them in the nineteenth century. Mostly starting with private breeders, large scale breeding would not occur until 1920. One of the most famous independent breeders was Hovey for being the first American breeder and naming a strawberry after himself. Many of the breeders of those early times were not even botanists. 

Nowadays the most popular species/strand of strawberry is the Honeoye, due to its production time, weather resistance, and size similarity in its produce. This is why all my strawberries are big and red when I buy them. Thanks to selective breeding and artificial selection I get great tasting strawberries in present times.

90,Twitch Plays Pokemon as an analogy for evolution,"This has always been in the back of my mind as an undergrad. I think of twitch plays pokemon as a great example for how systems evolve. 


For those of you who are not familiar, Pokemon Red was a gameboy colour game that was released in the mid-nineties. The goal of the game is to capture pokemon (short for pocket monster), train them (by battling other pokemon trainers), and become the strongest pokemon trainer in the game (i.e. defeating the Elite 4 + the Protagonist's rival). A few years ago, an emulator of the game was released and live-streamed on Twitch - but, it allowed anyone with an internet connection to play the same copy of the game [http://helixpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gen_1_(Pokemon_Red)]. Its the equivalent of playing Pokemon Red on Gameboy Colour while there are thousands of people over your shoulder pressing buttons. Apparently at 1.1 million unique visitors at one point in time played the same copy of Pokemon Red. As you can imagine, there was much chaos and a game that could normally be beat under 20 hours took 390 hours of continuous playing to beat. So where does the evolution aspect of it come in?

Let us consider two states:

State #1: The start of the game (i.e. analogous to a generic progenitor species)


State #2: The end of the game (i.e. analogous to the descendant/current species)


How does one go from a progenitor species to the descendant species (i.e. how do individuals within a species change over time)?

In Pokemon Red, there is only one metaphorical direction that counts, forward (i.e. towards ""completing the goal of the game""). There's a variety of actions that can be taken: those that move the game forward (moving through obstacles, battling pokemon, beating trainers, etc...), those that provide no benefit (i.e. pressing start button repeatedly does not move the game forward but does not hinder progress), those that are detrimental to the game (actions that can impair the rate of forward movement). In essence, actions come in three flavours: moving forward, not moving, or harming the rate of forward movement. In this system, there is no species extinction, only species stagnation or no-change states.

Actions can be thought of as mutations. There are beneficial mutations, neutral mutations, and deleterious mutations. The actions are dictated by thousands of individuals that appear to be acting randomly when observed for short periods of time but over long periods (say 390 hours), you're able to complete the game. Every player (or button presser) has a general idea as to how the game should be played (they know you go from gym 1 to gym 2 and so on and so forth) therefore they will press a button that moves the game forward. However, for every forward movement, there are so many actions that provide no forward movement (i.e. looking at helix fossil), or those that hinder progress (backtracking through a difficult puzzle area after completing most of it). If one were to plot out the # of actions it would likely be distriubted as follows: [# neutral actions &gt; # benefical actions &gt; # deleterious actions]. 

In essence the players the game can only select for forward movement (as you can't select for dead individuals, only those that bear the fruits of progeny i.e. game progress). However, bearing the fruits of progeny can be proven difficult if a random event destroys half the population and fixes deleterious genes (the equivalent of releasing your starter pokemon). As a consequence, it will now take much longer to beat the game (i.e. in Pokemon Red system, there is no extinction so the species must continue thriving in weakling or non-changing state or move forward).

Of course, the boundaries of this argument begin to breakdown. But it simply goes to show that a series of simple inputs of small beneficial, near neutral or deleterious weight can produce the required complexity to overcome the entirety of a pokemon game.

For example, humans and chimps descended from some human-chimp hybrid monkey, but where is it? shouldn't there be bones or some sort of leftover remaining to prove that it existed? this goes for pretty much any other example.

2. why did humans make such an intellectual leap compared to every other animal? Compared to pretty much everything else in the animal kingdom, humans are vastly more intelligent and capable of achieving things (like building cities, for example). I dont see chimps doing anything particularily impressive and i sure as hell dont see anything from the dog, cat, or fish families (to name a few) doing anything special either. why were WE given this gift?

I think not doing so hurts science overall though if we’re talking about it with respect to creationists. Many people believe that a scientific theory is the same thing as a hypothesis. So when the scientific community says that evolution is only a theory and not fact, it gives deniers that much more leverage in debates and reassurance in their own beliefs. 

I say that evolution is a fact not because I believe we are done learning about the topic, but because new research will only strengthen it.

2,Is there a gap between how evolution is presented to the public and how it is discussed in the scientific community?,"So I recently read an article that states how darwinism aka theory of evolution is taught to the public is quite different from how it is talked about in scientific circles. 

A couple of problems that as of yet, have no explain in Darwinism, remain like for instance:

-Phenotypic complexity (the origin of eyes, ears, body plans, i.e., the anatomical and structural features of living creatures);

-Phenotypic novelty, i.e., the origin of new forms throughout the history of life (for example, the mammalian radiation some 66 million years ago, in which the major orders of mammals, such as cetaceans, bats, carnivores, enter the fossil record, or even more dramatically, the Cambrian explosion, with most animal body plans appearing more or less without antecedents); and finally

-Non-gradual forms or modes of transition, where you see abrupt discontinuities in the fossil record between different types.

13,Have we observed evolution producing new information?,"The question is in the title but if you want my elaboration read on.

I was always inclined to believe that there had to be some outside interference in the evolution process (be that God, aliens of whatever). It just didn't make sense that some process would create all this complexity from nothing, regardless of wether God exists or not. And some arguments against evolution sounded very... sound. But now that I'm trying to really figure this topic out, I've studied multiple debates and read multiple sites (both for and against evolution) and it seems that most anti-evolution arguments have their rebuttals. And in the end, most of them come to ""you say it's hard to believe X has evolved but that only means you don't know how it evolved, not that it didn't"". That's me talking about topics like metamorphosis and irreducible complexity. I agree that this argument makes sense.

However, one argument that I haven't found any rebuttal to is that we never observed evolution producing new information. Evolution only uses existing information, combines something that is there to create some mix, but nothing new in principle occurs. All evolution observed just mixes and matches something that already is.

If evolution can make a fin become a leg or a wing, why couldn't fruit flies experiments make flies ditch their wings in exchange for something else? Or their legs? Or their eyes? We made them eat something else, we made them survive in high CO2, etc., but why nothing new? 

It seems that, in absence of time machine or ability to fast forward thousands of generations, proving evolution is same as proving theorem by means of induction. If we can prove an incremental transition, we can prove anything is possible, given enough time. But is there this proof of incremental transition?

Pro-evolution debaters say that microevolution is not distinct from macroevolution. That speciation happened. But isn't it obvious that birds changing beak sizes or moths changing color or fruit flies eating meat and mating only with those which also eat meat does not get us anywhere in terms of fish becoming amphibians becoming birds etc.?

For reference, I am an Orthodox Christian and don't believe in evolution for theological reasons, I have not investigated it scientifically in great detail, although I have an ordinary layman's understanding of it, perhaps a bit more than a normal man on the street, but nothing serious. I am interested in learning more about it so as to be able to understand what it ""really"" is, since so much evolutionist-against-creationist dialogue seems to be focused on the fact that we don't ""really"" know what it is, which may be true for all I know.

I'd like to be able to have fruitful dialogue with people in the future, and that basic misunderstanding is always an initial stumbling block.

For background, I have a degree in Philosophy and Linguistics and have taken mathematics up to precalculus, and done advanced (for an undergraduate) formal logic and set theory. I have studied some epistemological ideas relating to probability in the context of the philosophy of science, but I'm not well versed in the actual formalism of probability and statistics.

I'm just looking for some texts that provide an actually rigorous, technical, but general overview of evolutionary theory and the methodology behind it.

The males start mating with them at this age but they don't actually start ovulating and become able to conceive until a few years later.

Human females appear to follow the same pattern but just a few years later. They start puberty about 10, by the time they're about 12/13 they've developed ""sexual swellings"" on their chests that signal they're ready to start mating and, similarly to chimps, they don't actually start ovulating until several years later (first period doesn't actually mark beginning of fertility, girls don't typically start ovulating until 2-3 years afterwards).

I have the sinking feeling they will quickly run out of options this way. 

My question is how do you fight an evolving system?  Some ideas that come to mind are the following:

1. Kill all cells before they can reproduce into the next generation- very unlikely for most cancers.
2. Cycle through treatments.  This is probably ineffective as the cancer could retain its resistance to the other drugs for some time.
3. Multiple concurrent treatments.  This would make mutations more likely to be lethal, but few cancer patients can’t tolerate single treatment let alone several.
4. Reduce mutation rate to near zero, hope treatment can kill off entire population before they evolve resistance. Would require special tools, since many cancer treatments work by inducing DNA damage.

Anything else come to mind?  I know I am talking about cancer, but please don’t lose sight that I am interested in how evolutionary theory could be used to combat an evolving system in general.

40,Losos' Improbable Destinies. Phenotypic plasticity or evolution?,"I'm reading through Johnathon Losos' new book Improbable Destinies. He wants to argue that evolution happens very quickly and predictably. He doesn't pose much of a formal argument as much as he presents lots of observations that he explains as clear evidence of evolution occurring within a couple of generations. He works with anoles and sees very rapid changes in leg length in response to novel environments as an evolutionary adaptation. Reading through the book, I keep wondering why he isn't attributing this to phenotypic plasticity. This is an easy answer and a well understood explanation. There's no genetic argument and, in fact, he mostly skirts through genetics. He gets to my question about halfway through the book. And summarily writes it off: we don't have the genetic information to know so let' go with rapid evolution.

62,"Question: Is this a basic tenet of evolutionary theory? Is this controversial? It seems to me profoundly obvious, but I wonder is it a recognised principle of evolutionary theory","It seems to me that the most fundamental unit of life, consciousness and being is the association. That is... If one event occurs with enough rhythmic frequency life assumes it will continue because to do so is evolutionarily more advantageous than to assume the contrary or to ignore the event. If event A and event B correlate it is similarly advantageous for life to assume that they will continue to correlate until they don't. If life comes to depend upon the correlation and the correlation breaks then that life is destroyed. With enough variation a foothold can be gained that enables life to reach for ever deeper rhythms and patterns through adaptation and flexibility. Thus even the simplest organisms or bacterium act in accordance with an assumed order simply because their evolution is built upon a complex network of relational assumptions, constantly reaching further into being to uncover her greatest secrets. Thus inductive logic is a major factor, even a primary factor, behind the direction of evolution.

Billions of years of corrections and dimorphic selection results in more complex organisms that match their environments to ever more advanced degrees. Thus is our world revealed to us as objects, which are consistent patterns built into our genetic, epigenetic, biological, neural and mental systems. A horse's head does not float independently in a horse box. It has always comes with a body, throughout your life and those of your ancestors, and so we can project a body, and when someone asks you what you see you do not say ""a horse's head"", you say ""a horse"". And when your eye catches the tail of a snake in your path you jump out of your skin, tracing the body up to its head. If you subsequently see that the snake has lost its head the fear subsides instantaneously. The deviation from your mental models, the relational system of associations, marks itself out of the background, so that is what you focus on if you are deciding how to respond. You do not collect all of the information at once, computing the probabilities of attack, working through permutations of responses as in a game of chess. The information is already ""in you"", and the greater the number of confirmations, the greater the congruence of your in-built associations with the instant in time, the faster your physiological and mental responses coalesce around a singular reaction. All layers of an organism are systems designed to uncover the underlying patterns of correlation in their environments.

63,Optimized mutation rates?,"I apologize if this is already a well-discussed topic.

I was wondering how much research there has been into the mutations rates of various species, and how the mutation rates correspond to surrounding environments (not talking about mutagen levels).

DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to ensure the high-fidelity of DNA replication; however, mutations still make their way through.  Additionally, mutation rates are highly variable from one organism to the next.

Rather than being a side-effect of the level of efficacy of an organism's DNA repair mechanisms, could it be that particular mutation rates are selected for in a population? (Meaning DNA repair that is too effective might have long-term negative consequences for particular species)

In particular, I would expect organisms who are frequently exposed to dramatically different environments would have evolved to have a higher mutation rate.  A higher percentage of the progeny may have detrimental mutations, but their reproduction might yield offspring more evolved to an altered environment much more quickly than similar species with ""better"" DNA repair pathways.

Conversely, in a hypothetical environment that never changes, I would expect species to have evolved to have more accurate DNA repair mechanisms.

I would also expect organism complexity to play a large role in this optimization.

What I find curious; however, is that in nearly all locations around the globe, humans have pale palms.

One would suspect the rationale behind this is that palms are less frequently exposed to light; however, other areas of the body are exposed to light even less frequently, yet still produce large amounts of melanin (like the armpits).

What is special about the palms that necessitates reduced melanin production?  Is this simply a quirk left over from some ancient ancestors?
