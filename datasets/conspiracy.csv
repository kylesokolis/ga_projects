2,DEW weapons are not a conspiracy theory but a fact. Laser talk is not being pushed to distract from PG&amp;E. People are still trying to figure out what is going on.

There are many weapons...,"Ionispheroc heaters, smart meters, DEW, ect... and now there just so happened to be rain hitting all the areas where the fires are?

3,Pluto is a planet (and also the Scientific Method is a giant 'anti-science conspiracy'),"I feel the demotion of Pluto was a test. To see if people would accept something so outlandish as saying Pluto is not a planet. If they can change the planets, they can change anything they want.

And people didn't object in great numbers (I did, and still do. Planet planet planet planet planet), in fact they took the decision with joy. One day Pluto was a planet, the next, you were ridiculed for thinking so. ""Oh, didn't you hear, pluto's not a planet anymore"". It's a running joke. NdGT took personal responsibility (remember that for later).

Pluto ***IS*** a planet and here's why.

The claim of the IAU is ""we never defined what a planet actually was"".

That is a bold faced lie.

We did already have a definiton of planet.

&gt;Planet

&gt;A round body in a roughly circular orbit around a star.

You might say, ""geez, well, that makes everything a star"".

Think again, bucko.

&gt;What is not a planet?

&gt;Is an asteroid a planet?

&gt;- No, it goes around the star, but it is an irregular shape, not big enough to pull itself into a sphere. **Not a planet**.

&gt;Is a moon a planet? 

&gt;- No, it orbits another body, not the star. **Not a planet**.

&gt;Is a comet a planet?

&gt;- No, it orbit around the the star, and it is round, but it's orbit is long, not roughly circular. **Not a planet**.

&gt;Is a dual panet system, locked in a tidal orbit (second earth scenario) around a star a set of planets?

&gt;- Yes, despite not having 'cleared the orbit', a dual planet system is still two planets.

&gt;Then, what if asteroids started colecting in the Larange points between the planets? Making a pinwheel, planet - asteroids - planet - asteroids formation? Are the dual planets still planets?

&gt;- Yes, they are a dual planet system dragging asteroids in their Larange points.

&gt;Are thre planets in a locked orbit still planets?

&gt;- Yes, still planets.

&gt;And if asteroids collect at their larange points, are they still planets?

&gt;- Sigh, yes still planets, are we getting somewhere?

&gt; Indeed we are, we've arrived, actually, how many planets do you need to add in the same orbit to make them no longer planets? And you also agree asteroids in the orbit do not automatically make it not a planet.

&gt;- Ummmm......

&gt;Are ten planets in a system with asteroids still planets? Twenty? One Hundered? Where do you draw the line between this many round objects orbiting the sun and some asteroids in an orbit are planets and this many round objects in an orbit with some asteroids are not planets?

And there you have it. The Heap Paradox.

I shall express it with the ocean, I think it makes it easier to understand.

-If I take one drop from the ocean, is what is left still the ocean?

Of course.

-If I take another drop, two drops now. Still the ocean?

Of course.

-So we go on, taking one drop at a time, until there are only three drops worth sitting at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. That is all that is left with the ocean. We've agreed all the way down, taking one drop still leaves the ocean.

-So I take one drop. There are two drops. Is that still the ocean?

I guess.

-Ok, still the ocean. So we take away one more drop, leaving one drop in the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Is that still the ocean? If you say, no, that's only one drop. So two drops of water is the ocean? That's where you draw the line. Two drops is the ocean, one drop is not? It's still all that's left of the great ocean we started with, and we agreed taking all those other drops didn't stop it being the ocean.

So I guess it's still the ocean, then, right?

-Of course. Now we take away the last drop. There is no water left. Is that still the ocean.

No. Definatly not.

-So we sucked up watever the ocean was in this one drop? One drop is the ocean? And each drop we took to get here is an ocean to itself?

Ummmm.....

-So, considering the ocean isn't this one drop, and considering the ocean isn't there on the now dry floor of the Marianas Trench, where is the ocean. Or could it be that 'the ocean' doesn't exist? What is 'the ocean' objectively? Many molecules of water in one place. 

Geez, you could have just said ""the ocean is a social construct""

-Yeah, but you wouldn't appreciate it as much without discovering it for yourself in your own mind. I showed you the door, but you walked through it.

And I'm walking out. I'm now twenty minutes late for work. You need to learn how to wrap concepts up in a faster way. You're a real rambler.

-That's not the fist time I've heard that.

.

And once again, who came up with the Heap Paradox? The Ancient Greeks, who gave us our definition of ""a planet"". But that has been overwritten by presumptive reasoning (as opposed to Socratic reasoning as shown here).

And that's the conspiracy. We have moved away from the Ancient Greek base of our understanding. We should have build upon it. Why did we shift, and why right around the 1600s (Copernicus, etc.). Newton knew something, as Einstein. These are the 'thought experimeneers', the Socratic reasoners. The rest are trying to cover something up.

Like NdGT says, ""That's the great thing about science, it's right whether you believe it or not"". As the spokesman for presumptive reasoning, if that just another case of the Illuminati saying staight up to our face what is going on, but putting a spin on it to reverse the meaning.

They are making you believe the Scientific Method, and move away from the Socratic Method, while at the same time, moving science from making real world investigations (experiments) and moving to more and more math based models (simulations, proof on paper). Again, Einstein said something about that, the dangerous move away from experimentation and towards theoretical proof.

The Scientific Method says, ""here's the hypothosis, now let's find a way to prove it. Also, you can only prove something exists, you can never truly prove something doesn't exist.""

The Socratic Method says, ""here's the hypothosis, now let's find a way to disporve it. Also, you can only disprove something exists, you can never truly prove something exists""

Scientific Method is the science of subjective reality.

Socratic Method is the science of absolute truths.

Because Scientific Method starts with the assumption that the world we can detect exists, and anything that cannot be proven within the 3 dimentions does not exist.

&gt;For example. Ghosts can't exist, because life ends at death, and there is no detectable soul or whatnot. All life is biological.

&gt;But you are starting with the assmuption that all that exists exists within 3 dimentions.

&gt;What if a ghost is in the same place in the 4th dimention (time), but not in the same three, like if you were in the same 2 dimentions as someone but not the third, we call that being a long way away.

&gt;If you are standing at the same x and y, but your z is different, you are either right above them, or right underneath. They can still see you, right? Just by looking up. Right?

&gt;So if you are looking in the 4th direction (in the 4th dimention), you would be able to see someone in the same three dimentions, but not in the fourth. And, for a moment they pass through your field of view, like the persistence of vision. Wave you hand in front of your face you see a visual echo, right?

&gt;Now imagine that, but in the 4th dimention? 4th dimentional speed blur.

But, because the Scientific Method says that's not possible because we have no evidence for life after death, ghosts are psuedoscience.

But that's a hypothosis that works. 

Science, again, says, you have no proof. Socrates says, do you have any better ideas? If you can't disprove it, it's a valid theory.

But you can't prove a negative, I hear you shout.

Yes you can, very easily.

For example :

&gt;There is no air in this glass

&gt;I can prove that negative because I also know it is 100% full of water.

&gt;Equal and opposite (As I said, Newton knew something, his laws are logic).

&gt;I proved the negative something else takes it's place.

&gt;If the cup is full of water there can be no air.

90,"About the future of the conspiracy community, reddit, the new battleground Saidit.net and information warfare.","Hi guys. So I've been thinking a lot about recent events, a lot of people are frustrated with the shilling and there have been a lot of downs from our side because of the censorship going on at reddit. There are dark powers that don't want the corruption we talk about here to reach others so we are constantly under attack...
Since a lot of mods that are loyal to the conspiracy community have exposed the brigading, the constant attacks and the stalking against them to the admins and there has been 
almost no response, It's safe to say that there is a lot of corruption going on in reddit itself. I'm not saying all the reddit staff is involved but considering some mods get death threats often, well we have reasons to be paranoid.

User /u/magnora7 created a new website called [Saidit.](https://saidit.net/) I was hoping you guys would join us over there in order to have a better control of the attacks going on against us, but It's also to weaken their monopoly of
information. Basically I'm not telling you guys to quit reddit either, I think we still gotta keep up the fight over here. As I already said, the people in power don't like the fact that we expose the corruption going on in nearly all governments and 
as much as I think the quality of reddit itself has gone down, this place still reaches a lot of people. So I think It's important we take the responsability to continue posting about the political conspiracies. No I'm not trying to turn this into a 
fight of political conspiracies vs non political vs alternative stories, those of you who follow me know that I post about all that kind of shit. I'm just explaining the importance of exposing the corruption of politics. If we can weaken their monopoly of information we will be able to get a whole bunch of people not only on our side, but also against the true criminals behind the conspiracies.

So, we gotta constantly keep up the fight over here, organize ourselves at Saidit at the same time, while using all our resources to convince regular users to leave reddit by exposing them to the corruption going on and make them go over there too. So I'll need all the help you can give me to make regular users see the truth. All political subs, no not just here but even outside reddit itself have huge amounts of censorship and exaggerations of political correctness going on and we are probably the biggest community out there that knows about the secrets the people in power keep hiding from everyone, so we better take offensive actions don't you agree?

I also call the guys of TMoR and shills in general that attack this sub to surrender. I don't know what caused you to go down this path, be it apathy or a need of money or whatever, but for all the reasons I talked about before, you gotta admit there is a meaning in what we do if the information we talk about here reaches others and the constant attacks and demonization against the conspiracy community make that difficult. I admit we have our flaws but nobody is perfect. You can't use the excuse that what we do here doesn't matter anymore... so If you can tell us why you do it, who do you work for and if you can expose them in any way, I'm sure we would all appreciate it!

I'm sure you have all noticed it, but we are in the middle of an information warfare.

108,[Meta] 9/11 Admins want sub quarantined?,"I subscribed to 911 truth after they got quarantined on reddit.  After seeing a post from the admins that they were trying to decide what to do after the quarantine, I sent a message telling them I may have and idea and if they didn't come up with anything to let me know.  They sent me a message asking what I had in mind, so I told them they could move off of reddit and I would be happy to tell them an easy way to do it.   They never responded so I thought they had come up with something else.   


About a week ago, I checked in on the sub to see people discussing the quarantine was bs, and asking what could be done.  I made a post saying that I had approached admins on starting a community off of reddit but they weren't interested, but if people were interested I would be happy to make one.    


Some members and I started talking about it, price points and what all could be done ( free community just for that sub, but if we wanted an option for other subs to come in, we could definitely do it.  We would have to charge a membership fee, what that would be, what other sites charged like WhatsApp etc.  We were also discussing that if reddit were doing this to increase ad revenue, which was what was explained to me when I asked why all the quarantines,   if people moved to another site it would make them think twice. )    


That's when a sub admin removed my post saying that I was violating reddit's policy against transactions involving prohibited goods or services.  I thought it was crap, especially when reading it and seeing the policy was talking about firearms, drugs, prostitution, stolen goods and the like,  but respected the admins decision.  Even when people were keeping the conversation going, I didn't respond.   


Today, I'm at work when I get a notification from reddit.  I though it was odd because I haven't commented or posted with that account since the admin removed my post.  I checked it to see that the account has now been permanently suspended from reddit for ""breaking reddit"", with a link to that post in 911 truth. After digging I found that breaking reddit means that I interfered with normal use of the site.  Which includes ""introducing malicious code, make it difficult for anyone else to use reddit due to actions, block sponsored headlines, create programs that violate any of the API rules or assist anyone in misusing reddit"".   


So I guess I have a 2-fer conspiracy theory.  First, the 911 truth admins wanted the sub quarantined (or at the very least are just fine with it being quarantined) and second is that reddit is silencing anyone who can create a place off of reddit for those people they are leaving without a voice.

116,Modern Death Culture,"**Introduction**

If you can, take a moment to watch this clip from the immensely popular TV Show ""The Walking Dead."" 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHI4tu5WCWE#action=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHI4tu5WCWE#action=share)

If you cannot watch the clip for whatever reason***,*** it is a brutal death scene, and it was difficult for me to sit through all of it. Yet, most today can watch these types of scenes and not ebat an eye.

To me, though, this goes beyond just desensitization. There seems to be a love, almost an adoration for this type of focus on death and brutality in our world today.

In other words, I believe there is a re-emergence of a ritualistic fascination with death in our modern day world, but why?

*Well, when we lose meaning beyond ourselves, than the meaning of life becomes death itself.*

This post will explore the glorification, adoration, and even worship of death today, as well as the nihilism and narcissism associated with modern death culture. We can find life again, I think, if we start thinking beyond ourselves. 

**What is Death Culture?**

It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? But before we get deeper into this post, you probably need to understand what I even mean by death culture in the first place. When doing research for this post, I actually stumbled on a book called ""Architects of the Culture of Death""  and although I have not finished the entire book yet, it is definitely worth the read. 

The authors, Donald DeMarco and Benjamin Walker, essentially argue that loss of religion (specifically Christianity) has created *""the rise of a new image of humanity...one in which humanity is the unintended result of blind, natural forces rather than a creation of God in his own image, and consequently, one in which human beings are purely material creatures cast into existence by indifferent nature and forced to define salvation themselves.""*

Now, before we go on in the post, I am not sitting here arguing that every aspect of religion is good, or that upon reading this, you should immediately join a church. I am NOT writing this to convert you to any religion or spirituality. Rather, I am asking you to examine what happens to people if they do lose God or the thought of something beyond themselves - or, in other words, what happens when ""God is Dead""?

Death culture, ultimately, is the depersonalization of Death itself. According to the DeMarco and Walker, without a Creator, ""we imagine ourselves being the only source of order...the most godlike being in a godless cosmos, and hence the only thing worthy of worship and obedience.""

Going back to the Walking Dead scene, I feel people can get through those type of brutal scenes today because they have depersonalized death. Does rejection of God lead us to reject the ""sense of man?"" Without God, what creates meaning in our lives? Sure, you can claim meaning comes from what we make of it, but is that really happening today? Do people feel they have fulfilled and meaningful lives in today's world? We will go back to this question later.

Perhaps this is getting a little too philosophical, so before you decide to agree or disagree with these claims, let us look at our world today, and I always love to start with my favorite, pop culture.

**Pop Culture**

*""For some of us, Halloween is every day."" - Tim Burton*

Tim Burton has made an art out of the glorification of death. Before anybody reading starts to hyperventilate because they believe I am criticizing Tim Burton or his work, that is not the case at all. He is clearly an icon. Rather, I want to explore some of the messages his targeted audiences (kids and teens) might be getting as they watch his films. 

Burton essentially found a way to transform the once taboo characters of death to almost heroic entities. Demons, goblins, and ghouls are the good guys, and everybody else needs to open themselves up to the ""good in darkness."" In Burton's movie's you often root for the dark characters. 

Perhaps there is innocence to this all, and hey, it is fun, right? But, let us continue to look deeper into pop culture.

Along with Tim Burton, you have famous families like ""The Adaams Family"" who also make death and darkness seem good and exciting. One of the essential themes in the show is that ""torture is pleasure.""

Wikipedia notes, ""According to The Telegraph, the Addamses 'are one of the most iconic families in American history, up there with the Kennedys'.\[6\]""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Addams\_Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family)

It all seems innocent and ""fun"" on the surface, but then I think about the target audience: kids and teens. Most kids, fortunately, do not have a lot of experience with darkness and torture today (in America at least). So, what happens, then, is their only association with death and darkness in their minds is comedy and fun. Is there something troubling here?

Before you think I am forming connections that are not there, I want to explore, quickly, some other things kids are likely to see today in pop culture:

They can listen to Ke$ha's ""Die Young"" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48)), they can watch endless shows about the apocalypse and zombies ([https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/t-magazine/end-of-the-world.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/t-magazine/end-of-the-world.html)), they can watch Eminem immerse himself in a blood bath ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAuo8IOFNuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAuo8IOFNuE)), they can watch yet another video about dying young by Roddy Rich - *just in case they forgot that dying young is cool* ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FctI8l2KKw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FctI8l2KKw8)), they can watch Poppy smeared in blood ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbQsxWKfTSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbQsxWKfTSU)), or they can even watch ""The Santa Clarita Diet"" - a show about cannibalism. 

I could do this all day, but I think you are getting the point, and before you think I am ""cherry-picking"", I am not the only one to notice this ""celebration of death"" in modern culture.

Dina Khapeva, from the University of Michigan Press, writes, ""Popular culture has reimagined death as entertainment and monsters as heroes, reflecting a profound contempt for the human race.""

In this book, Khapeva emphasizes ""the current cult of death reduces the relevance and centrality of human beings, rationalism, and religion.""

In other words, it goes back to depersonalization. With this obsession of death, humanity loses relevancy and importance. Humanity becomes meaningless, and our sense for others becomes distorted. We can sit there, eat popcorn, and film somebody as they die (and not even bat an eye):

[https://nypost.com/2017/07/20/oh-he-just-died-disturbing-video-shows-teens-mocking-drowning-man/](https://nypost.com/2017/07/20/oh-he-just-died-disturbing-video-shows-teens-mocking-drowning-man/)

**Losing My Religion**

""*To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering."" - Nietzche*

Today, more Americans than ever identify their religion as ""none.""

[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religious-affiliation-is-rising/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religious-affiliation-is-rising/)

Many view this as progress, even those reading this post. Again, I am not here to argue that religion is inherently good or bad. I am not here to convert anyone. Rather, I want to look deeply at the effects when society loses its religion.

Well, first, our society is more nihilistic than ever, but I cannot speak of nihilism without Nietzche.:

*""Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value.""*

*Further, ""Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value, belief in God (which justifies the evil in the world) and a basis for objective knowledge. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. However, it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing: in its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution. It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity “not because we lived too far from it, rather because we lived too close”.\[29\] As such, the self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism. Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as the interpretation, Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond skepticism to a distrust of all meaning.\[30\]\[31\]""*

[https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/](https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/)

Our society has seemed to outgrow God or religion, but at the same time, a sense of meaning is then lost - or intrinsic meaning, as noted in the quote.

So, if there is no intrinsic meaning, then extrinsic meaning becomes the only option: money, cars, food, sex, drugs, attention, fame, power, and so on - anything that makes people feel an ounce of pleasure in this vapid existence.

**Paradox of Hedonism**

*“Unbeing dead isn't being alive.” - E. E. Cummings* 

In an existence without meaning, pleasure becomes meaning, and a hedonist will try to capitalize on as much pleasure as possible. But then a paradox is created:

According to wikipedia, ""The paradox of hedonism, also called the pleasure paradox, refers to the practical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of pleasure. Unfortunately for the hedonist, constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or happiness in the long run—or even in the short run, when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\_of\_hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism)

In the United States, most of us are living more pleasurable lives than nearly any time in history, but are we happier?

Well, looking at the rising suicide rates, it does not appear so:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/06/07/u-s-suicide-rates-rise-sharply-across-the-country-new-report-shows/?utm\_term=.14c39953bc09](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/06/07/u-s-suicide-rates-rise-sharply-across-the-country-new-report-shows/?utm_term=.14c39953bc09)

And while I cannot state hedonism is the essential cause of suicide, I am claiming that a growingly nihilistic, apathetic, and hedonistic society has led many to believe life is essentially meaningless, and therefore, not worth living.

But going back to ""Death Culture"", I also believe that living in a world where death is glorified is not helping anyone out either. The popular TV show ""13 Reasons Why"", for example, sparked a ""suicide contagion effect"" and led to an increase in suicidal thoughts in teens:

[https://www.wmtw.com/article/half-of-teens-who-watch-13-reasons-why-have-increased-suicidal-thoughts/25242777](https://www.wmtw.com/article/half-of-teens-who-watch-13-reasons-why-have-increased-suicidal-thoughts/25242777)

Yet, the series is renewed for another season, and nobody bats an eye.

**The Walking Dead**

""*Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds*.""- Bhagavad Gita

When I saw a post about ""13 Reasons Why"" and its associated suicide risk linked somewhere on Reddit, I came across a comment I wish I saved.

Essentially the commenter said the problem with the series was that the people who write the episodes were likely not suicidal or depressed, so how could they paint an accurate picture of suicide or depression? What happens, instead, is the idea becomes glorified and not painted realistically.

Going back to the Addams Family, it is easy to laugh at pain and torture when the viewer has not been tortured. Going back to the ""Walking Dead"" clip, it is easy to watch a person get murdered on TV when one has not experienced murder in real life. If someone is not suicidal or depressed, another's person suicide or depression becomes entertainment.

This goes back to that depersonalization, again. We disconnect ourselves from other people's pain and suffering. Sure, you can say it is fictionalized, but I have a quick anecdote:

**^(Warning: Anecdote)**

*Before I was in abusive relationship, I had no problem watching any movie about any topic. Take me to the scariest and most brutal movies - I could do it. After my abusive relationship (I was nearly killed and I experienced murder in his family), everything changed. I went to see ""Wolf on Wall Street"" and I had to walk out of the theater several times, especially the scene where the main character was beating up his wife.*

What happened? I now understood the suffering, and I was now able to empathize with the characters, real or not. 

But in an increasingly comfortable and constantly pleasured society, people are losing that ability to empathize. I am not claiming that I want people to suffer, but it goes back to the idea that too much pleasure is simply just not good for people. We become so comfortable, that we lose our ability to relate to the human experience. 

According to Berkeley, empathy is on the decline, and ""While the study didn’t examine why empathy may be declining, the authors draw on prior research to speculate that culprits could include the corresponding rise in narcissism among young people, the growing prevalence of personal technology and media use in everyday life, shrinking family size (dealing with siblings may teach empathy), and stronger pressures on young people to succeed academically and professionally. ""

[https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/research\_digest/empathy\_on\_the\_decline](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/research_digest/empathy_on_the_decline)

But what does this have to do with the culture of death? The answer is narcissism. When there is no God - no meaning outside ourselves, we begin to worship our very selves. When somebody only cares about themselves, are they really even human anymore? What is life without other people? What is humanity without other people? In a sense, we BECOME the Walking Dead. We personify Death. 

**So, what's the conspiracy?**

I could probably write a whole post about the hidden occult, Satanic references in pop culture today, but I challenge you to explore that area yourself. 

Rather, I think the conspiracy, at the most basic level, is that when we embrace death, we forget to care about life. If we lose what makes us human, then how are we different than animals or zombies? A population of zombies does not change anything. They are easier to control. They do not value themselves or others. They do not think. They just want. 

On a deeper conspiratorial level, what if ""they"" are hiding God from us?

**Conclusion**

*“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”  - Mark Twain* 

This post may come off as too philosophical, and there are a lot of unanswered questions. As noted earlier, I am reading an entire book on this topic, and I cannot cover everything I wanted to in one single post. 

I have been writing a lot on Reddit, and I keep getting the question, ""So what's the solution? How do we solve this?""

I do not have an answer to this, but I think with my writing, all I want to bring to people is an increasing awareness. There is nothing wrong with talking about death or even joking about death. We all have to deal with morality in some way. 

But, I want people to examine the world around them. If you're a parent, for example, should your kid be watching shows and movies that glorify death every night? 

Or, if you are just somebody reading this, how do we find meaning in our lives? Should we eat more, have sex more, drink more, or give into hedonism? Or, should we go out there and help other people? Should we start to search for something outside of ourselves?

No matter what you believe spiritually or religiously, I do believe that meaning can ONLY be found in our connections with other people. Yet, our society is more disconnected than ever.

I agree with Khapeva earlier who came to the conclusion that this culture of death may really be about our **hatred of one another.** 

Let us start embracing life - not death. Let us reach out to others. Let us ""re-personalize"" and connect with each other again. Besides, the secret to happiness seems to be helping others:

134,"4,250% increase in fetal deaths reported to VAERS after Flu Shot given to pregnant women"," 

**Documentation received from the National Coalition of  Organized Women (NCOW) states that between 2009 and 2010 the mercury-laden combined flu vaccinations have increased Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Systems (VAERS) fetal death reports by 4,250 percent in pregnant women.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Eileen Dannemann, NCOW’s director, made abundantly clear that despite these figures being known to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the multiple-strain, inactivated flu vaccine containing mercury (Thimerosal) has once again been recommended to pregnant women as a safe vaccination.

Outraged by the CDC’s total disregard for human life, Ms. Dannemann accused the CDC of ‘willful misconduct,’ saying that they are responsible for causing the deaths of thousands of unborn babies.  **She stated that the CDC deliberately misled the nation’s obstetricians and gynecologists and colluded with the** ***American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology***  **(AJOG) to mislead the public by advertising the flu vaccine as a safe  vaccine for pregnant women when they knew fully well that it was causing  a massive spike in fetal deaths.**

Ms. Dannemann wrote:

&gt;*“Not only did the CDC fail to disclose the spiraling spike in fetal death reports in real time during the 2009 pandemic season as to cut the fetal losses, but also we have documented by transcript Dr. Marie McCormick, chairperson of the Vaccine Safety Risk Assessment Working Group (VSRAWG) on September 3, 2010, denying any adverse events in the pregnant population during the 2009 Pandemic  season.”* \[1\]  
 

### HIDING LIFE-OR-DEATH EVIDENCE

Because the H1N1 pandemic vaccine had never been tested on the pregnant population, and to lessen the intensity of fears of the unknown risks, Dr. Marie McCormick of the CDC was employed to keep track of all adverse events during the 2009 pandemic season, including those adverse events in the pregnant population. Dr. McCormick was responsible for sending monthly reports to the Secretary of the Health and Human  Services (HHS), citing any suspicious adverse events.

According to Ms. Dannemann, NCOW has been unable to  obtain access to these monthly reports. After sending a Freedom of  Information Act request to the CDC, she was told that she may have to wait 36 months to access what should be published public reports.

The letter continues:

&gt;*“The Advisory Committee on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV)  and CDC were confronted with the VAERS data from NCOW on September 3,  2010, in Washington, D.C., and then again by conference call on  September 10, and then again in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 28, 2010.  On both September 3 and September 10, Dr. Marie McCormick clearly denied that there were any adverse events for pregnant women from the 2009 flu vaccine.”*  
 

### 

### COLLABORATION AND CORRUPTION

Despite evidence that the CDC knew of the 4,250 percent  increase in fetal death reports in 2009/2010, in order to ensure the  continuance of the vaccine program for pregnant women, the CDC published  a study in AJOG authored by Dr. Pedro Moro of the CDC in the fall of  2010. The study articulated that there were only 23 miscarriages caused  by the single flu vaccine in 19 years between 1990 – 2009, an average of  1.2 miscarriages per year. This study formed the basis of a CDC  worldwide publicity campaign that the flu shot was safe for pregnant  women by willfully and strategically excluding the 2009 pandemic data,  which was available to them. Ms. Dannemann said:

&gt;***“Both the CDC and AJOG were well aware of the fact  that physicians and the public were awaiting the results of the 2009  H1N1 untested vaccine on pregnant women, amid solid assurances to the  public at the beginning of the pandemic season that the CDC was on top  of collecting any adverse reactions to the vaccine by establishing the  Vaccine Safety Risk Assessment Working Group chaired by Dr. Marie Mc  Cormick (VSRAWG).”***  
 

Ms. Dannemann stated that by including the 2008/2009 flu  season’s data but excluding the available 2009 data from the 2009/2010  flu season in the study published in AJOG, Dr. Moro was able to give the  impression that the 2009/2010 pandemic season was covered in the data,  which of course it was not. Ms. Dannemann believes that this was a  deliberate act on his part because he was aware of the fetal death spike  in the 2009/2010 data at the time of preparing the study and purposely  excluded the 2009 pandemic data from the study to hide this fact.

In the fall of 2010, just in time for the  new flu season, media outlets all over the world publicized the AJOG,  peer-reviewed CDC/Dr. Moro study as adamant proof that the flu shot is  safe for pregnant women. The NCOW documents prove at the same time as  widely publicizing advice that all pregnant women required the combined  flu vaccination, the CDC was busy organizing ten non-profit  organizations, to sign a joint letter to urge obstetricians and  gynecologists to continue to vaccinate their pregnant patients.

WHAT THE CDC FAILED TO TELL PREGNANT MOMS

On September 27, 2012, the *Human and Environmental Toxicology Journal*  (HET) published Dr. Gary Goldman’s study that confirms NCOWs data, a  4,250 percent increase in the number of miscarriages and stillbirths  reported to VAERS in the 2009/2010 flu season. \[4\] The study points out  an astounding fact that no one saw until the publishing of the Goldman  study in HET: *the CDC had recommended the double-dosing of the  pregnant population with the seasonal flu vaccine with mercury and the  untested H1N1 vaccine with mercury*.

In his abstract, Goldman said:

&gt;*“The aim of this study was to compare  the number of inactivated-influenza vaccine–related spontaneous abortion  and stillbirth (SB) reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting  System (VAERS) database during three consecutive flu seasons beginning  2008/2009 and assess the relative fetal death reports associated with  the two-vaccine 2009/2010 season.”*  
 

The facts that Goldman exposed are  extremely disturbing. He highlights the fact that the safety and  effectiveness of the A-H1N1 had never been established in pregnant women  and that the combination of two different influenza vaccines had never  been tested on pregnant women at all.

Even more worrisome is the fact that the A-H1N1 vaccine inserts from the various manufacturers contained this warning:

***“It is also not known whether these vaccines  can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect  reproduction capacity.’’*** (emphasis added)

Dr. Goldman also pointed out that the developing fetus  is indirectly exposed to mercury when thimerosal-containing vaccines are  administered to a pregnant woman. He outlined a study written by A.R.  Gasset, M. Itoi, Y. Ischii and R.M. Ramer who examined what happened  after rabbits were vaccinated with thimerosal–containing radioactive  mercury. Goldman stated that from one hour post-injection to six hours  post-injection, the level of radioactive mercury in the blood dropped  over 75 percent. *Yet from two hours post-injection to six hours  post-injection, there were significantly increased radioactivity levels  in the fetal brain, liver, and kidney*.

Dr. Goldman concluded that because the rates of miscarriage reported  to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) for the single  flu vaccine were relatively low, health care providers developed a false  sense of security that flu vaccines administered during pregnancy were  safe. Goldman explained that just because a single vaccine has been  tested and considered to be relatively safe, this does not mean that  vaccinating pregnant women with two or more Thimerosal containing  vaccines will be safe for them or their unborn babies. Overall, Goldman  firmly believes that the VAERS grossly underestimates the true rates of  miscarriage and other adverse events encountered in the US population.  Remember, it is estimated that less than a tenth of true adverse  reactions are reported to the VAERS with a one percent reporting rate  for serious adverse events, including death, according to a study led by  former FDA Commissioner Dr. David A. Kessler. \[5\]

As seen in the Goldman study, with the return to a single flu shot,  the flu vaccine-related reports of fetal loss have returned to a  significantly lower level compared to the high level of fetal loss  reports in the two-dose 2009/2010 flu season. However, higher than  background flu shot vaccine-related fetal losses continue to be reported  to the VAERS.

Furthermore, the Goldman study recommends that the babies who survived the deadly double dose in utero be monitored:

&gt;*“In addition, because of the order of magnitude  increase in fetal-loss report rates, from 6.8 fetal loss reports per  million pregnant women vaccinated in the single-dose 2008/2009 season to  77.8 in the two-dose 2009/2010 season,* ***further long term studies are needed to assess adverse outcomes in the surviving children****.  Additional research concerning potential synergistic risk factors  associated with the administration of Thimerosal-containing vaccines is  warranted, and the exposure-effect association should be verified in  further toxicological and case-control studies.”* (emphasis added)

Aside from fetal deaths, the CDC initiative to increase uptake of  vaccines in pregnant women continues to fuel the increases in the levels  of neurodevelopmental, developmental, behavioral abnormalities, and  chronic illness in the surviving children. Due to omitting reports of  fetal deaths, the CDC enjoys success in increasing the uptake and number  of vaccines in the pregnant population. The Advisory Committee on  Immunization Practices (ACIP) is now recommending not only the flu shot  (with mercury) but also the Tdap vaccine.

### CONCLUSION

The work of NCOW and Dr. Goldman has proven that  potential lives are being destroyed before they are even old enough to  draw their first breath. Developing fetuses who are fortunate enough to  survive the onslaught of vaccinations now being recommended to pregnant  women then need to play a form of Russian Roulette from the day they are  born, because their caring parents followed the advice they were given  by professionals who have been deliberately misguided.

Eileen Dannemann and her team have proven with their  remarkable work that both public and professionals alike are being lied  to and deceived by organizations put in place by the government to  sanction our vaccination programs. In my opinion, this is genocide and  the sooner people realize that all vaccines come with an element of risk  and begin to research the dangers for themselves, the sooner these  insane experiments will end.

141,Chimpanzees are afraid of water.,"1.  Chimpanzees are afraid of water.

2. Some Chimpanzees, likely displaced by war with fellow chimpanzee tribes, were forced to adapt to be able to use the water as a food source/defense mechanism against other chimpanzees.

3. Overtime, certain groups of Chimpanzees evolved to be more adept at circumnavigating the waters and gained a substantial enough food supply to warrant their tribe to move out of the jungle altogether. 

4. Thus, either forced out, or left willingly, early apes were also forced to overcome new, environmental delimiters.

5. This adaption required an increased brain capacity to adapt and solve problems prior unknown to the hominid genus. 

6. With our primary food source now the ocean, our brain capacity enabling us to problem solve our way into a prior unknown food source, was only boosted.

7. See the difference here is that not only did hominids discover a new food source, but it was a food source that was abundantly less sought after by their rivals. They discovered a food supply theoretically they had no competition for minus other ocean dwellers and a few land predators. 

8. This abundance of food enabled their brain capacity to swell. 

9. Overtime this adaption meant the smartest and most well adapted for water hominoids lived on.

10.  Because of this, water-adapted, intelligent apes were able to spread to previous unknown areas of the world prior species of chimpanzees could never have hoped to conquer.

11.  Because of their ability to take over large swathes of land pretty much unimpeded by other hominoids they were able to spread far and wide without much reproach minus existing predators.  

12.  However, out in the grasslands, monkeys were not commonly seen and thus not typical prey for existing predators. This in conjunction with the fact that our social capabilities kept us in large groups, the grassland predator phenomena seems to be mitigated. 

13.  Having larges areas of land, humans were able to eventually have land cultivate crops they found indigenously over time and feed larger groups of people. 

14.  And thus, we have determined a split from Chimpanzees and Humans. ",conspiracy,1542773442,MrDoettoem,30,1,True,2018-11-20

I think the most obvious indication of the frequencies increasing on this planet is a perception that time is speeding up.

There are other indications as well. 

Per Aluna Ash:

Something Huge is About to Happen

Get ready family.  We are about to experience some huge shifts.

Shown the vibration of the planet increasing to frequencies it has never come close to before.

This creates a chain reaction.

If you are sensitive to energy or pressure changes, you can already feel this.

Gaia will be releasing energy in different locations.

There is energy building beneath the surface.

We are moving from 3rd density to 4th density.

Note: The full shift to 4th density will take place several decades from now.

In the meantime, there are and will be palpable changes along the way.

It followed a character who was born into a square box (hospital room), slept on a square, in a box full of more square boxes, surrounded by them (bed, bedroom, house, neighborhood..), went to a bigger box, sat in a square shape of boxes, reading squares with others (school, books, class..) only to go to a bigger box after box after box full of squares just to earn a square (middle, high, college, degree), that put you into the biggest of square boxes forever (tall office building, square windows) where you toiled to move up and up to the biggest box in the biggest of boxes (promotions), where if I’m not mistaken either the character jumped off the roof or just died as a total square, where he was thus put into a box and buried in a box full of squares.

It was very dark, but at the same time a lesson about not conforming, to rebel against this massive machine that churns out squares,

Kanye wrote this in 2004 but everyone thinks he's crazy because he decided to speak out against the system.  

Rap used to be about social issues and problems that society faced but it has turned into a glamorization of drug use and pop ideas.  I urge all the /r/conspiracy users to listen to the album College Dropout by Kanye West.  

Not only is it one of the best hip-hop albums of all time it is a good precursor to the ideas of Kanye West and his ideas.

186,Mind Produces a Greater Orgasm Than Sex,"Good sex is largely mental.

Sex without a mental additive is dull and boring, providing little to no orgasm.

Genocide can cause an orgasm 100x greater than sex.

No sex equates to sharper, more prominent dreams, because you have a booster that your mind uses to guide your dream body. If you masturbate before sleep you'll likely miss dreaming.

If you fantasize about your enemy having dirty sex with you, it is a good story to masturbate to and that sort of foreplay leads to good sex.

So my friends, sex is shit, what's good is mind over sex. You'll probably have a better wank half the time over fucking unless you're in love or in a grand situation. 

Thus, the problem is finding love and creating tension, as to make good use of sex.

Other states of life exist where you may pleasure from the mind more intensely, such as with dreams, which can produce that renown enemy scene more fluently.

Perhaps we shouldn't see the greatest pleasure as sexual pleasure, but more what the mind can achieve possibly, a kind of sex free of penises and vaginas.

196,Season differences across relatively short distances prove the sun isn't 93 million miles away,"This has bugged me or a while and I finally went and collected data to see if it all makes sense. I don't think it does.

So we are told the sun is around 93 million miles away and is roughly 2,000 degrees F. This 2,000 degrees travels across the vacuum of space and dissipates to our temperatures here, according to the model we are given, and this gives us a rough dissipation rate of .00002 degrees F per mile. All temps used are F.

For reference points, I stayed on one continent and used Ann Arbor, Michigan and Miami, Florida, approx. 1373 miles apart according to google, or roughly .00001% of the total distance the heat travels. See where I'm going?

Average temperatures in Ann Arbor for January are a low of 18 (.009% of original temp) and a high of 31 F (.0155% """"). Average temperatures in Miami for January are a low of 65 (.0325% """") and a high of 73 F(.0365% """"). 

None of these are anywhere close to what they should be given the distance between Ann Arbor and Miami and how far the heat originally already traveled to get here. I can't reconcile these numbers through any math I know, and the research I've done is a lot of theory and no hard evidence. Continental distances are hard data and our average temps are hard data through measurable history and any model should line up with them mathematically. 93 million miles at 2000 F doesn't line up, not anywhere even close.

270,"[Original Content] The False Memory Hoax: A look into the history of the original board members of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, which was set up as a psychological operation to deny the existence of Ritual Abuse. Ritual Abuse is an offshoot of MK-ULTRA, Trauma-Based Mind Control","Once the evidence of extreme abuse began surfacing in surprising numbers, the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation' (FMSF) was set up to promote the theory that victims are suffering from a syndrome that creates false memories, often at the suggestion of psychotic parents or over-zealous psychiatrists.

The members of the FMSF have been called as expert witnesses in hundreds of trials around the United States and have been routinely quoted as experts in the media. Their mission has been exceptionally successful, as the 'false memory syndrome' has become accepted as a fact in most of the public consciousness. Unfortunately, people rarely stop to ask the question, who exactly are the members of the FMSF, and how solid is their science?

Peter J. Freyd initiated the founding of the FMSF after being accused of sexual abuse by his daughter, Jennifer. His behavior has been particularly suspect, such as accusing his daughter of being brain damaged, despite the fact that she holds a PhD in Psychology, graduated magna cum laude from Penn and is currently a tenured professor of psychology at the University of Oregon. Speaking to The Oregonian, Jennifer Freyd stated that “I’m sometimes flabbergasted that my memory is considered ‘false’ and my alcoholic father’s memory is considered rational and sane.”

Peter Freyd once stated that “With the help of Harold Lief and Martin Orne, the FMSF quickly gathered a respectable appearing advisory board, giving the new syndrome an aura of scientific acceptance.” Interestingly, Dr. Martin T. Orne has been heavily involved with MK-ULTRA experiments since the early '60s, where he undertook hypnosis studies at Harvard Medical School with a $30,000 grant from the CIA.

CIA documents have confirmed that Orne had a 'top secret' clearance in MK-ULTRA. He has published many papers relevant to the creation of a 'Manchurian candidate', including one called “Can a hypnotized subject be compelled to carry out otherwise unacceptable behavior?”, another called “The significance of unwitting cues for experimental outcomes: Toward a pragmatic approach”, and lastly “Restricted use of success cues in retrieval during post-hypnotic amnesia”.This is an interesting subject matter history given the FMSF's insistence that hypnotism is illegitimate.

Dr. Harold Lief was involved with brain electrode experiments at Tulane University, a notorious MK-ULTRA institution. Another prominent member, David Dinges, was a co-worker with Martin T. Orne and has been involved in research for Naval Intelligence, who oversaw the precursor mind control experiments to MK-ULTRA.

Founding member Ralph Underwager once proudly proclaimed to the pro-pedophilia publication Paidika:

“What I have been struck by as I have come to know more about and understand people who choose paedophilia is that they let themselves be too much defined by other people. That is usually an essentially negative definition. Paedophiles spend a lot of time and energy defending their choice. I don't think that a paedophile needs to do that. Paedophiles can boldly and courageously affirm what they choose. They can say that what they want is to find the best way to love. I am also a theologian and as a theologian, I believe it is God's will that there be closeness and intimacy, unity of the flesh, between people.

A paedophile can say: ""This closeness is possible for me within the choices that I've made."" Paedophiles are too defensive. They go around saying, ""You people out there are saying that what I choose is bad, that it's no good. You're putting me in prison, you're doing all these terrible things to me. I have to define my love as being in some way or other illicit."" What I think is that paedophiles can make the assertion that the pursuit of intimacy and love is what they choose. With boldness, they can say, ""I believe this is in fact part of God's will.""

Regarding the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, Columbia Journalism Review stated:

""Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter. The [False Memory Syndrome] foundation is an aggressive, well-financed PR machine adept at manipulating the press, harassing its critics, and mobilizing a diverse army of psychiatrists, outspoken academics, expert defense witnesses, litigious lawyers, Freud bashers, critics of psychotherapy, and devastated parents.”

The FMSF has repeatedly cited a study presented at a Harvard conference where researchers were repeatedly able to implant the false memory of mundane tasks like grocery shopping, into their subjects using techniques such as hypnosis. It has been championed as proof that memories are easily manipulated. However, research has shown that memories of abuse function very differently than average memories.

“However, leading memory researchers such as Dr. Bessel van der Kolk of Harvard Medical School maintain that traumatic memories, which typically are engraved in the sensorimotor processes, are not subject to the same kinds of contamination that can affect normal memory. Traumatic amnesia, described in the DSM-III-R as psychogenic amnesia, is a phenomenon which has been known to mental health professionals for more than 100 years. The clinically observed characteristics of traumatic memory formation and retrieval match precisely the patterns of memory recovery exhibited by SRA [Satanic Ritual Abuse] survivors, and strongly confirm the reality of their cult abuse.”

There is also the case of Paul and Shirley Eberle, who are famous for propagating the idea of a 'satanic panic', that the widespread reporting of ritual abuse is merely a social contagion. They have published two books titled “The Politics of Child Abuse” and “The Abuse of Innocence” which promote this theory, and have been cited as experts in courts and the press. Ms. Magazine wrote a review of the interesting past of the Eberles, stating:

“What is startling about the Eberles' reputation as ground-breaking experts in the field is that their dubious credentials have not been widely challenged. Paul and Shirley Eberle edit a soft-core magazine in California called the L.A. Star that contains a mixture of nude photos, celebrity gossip, telephone sex ads, and promos for The Politics of Child Abuse.

In the 1970's, however, the Eberles were also publishing hard-core pornography. Their publication, Finger, depicted scenes of bondage, S &amp; M, and sexual activities involving urination and defecation. A young girl portrayed with a wide smile on her face sits on top of a man whose penis is inside of her; a woman has oral sex with a young boy in a drawing entitled ""Memories of My Boyhood.""

The Eberles were featured nude on one cover holding two life-size blow up dolls names ""Love Girl"" and ""Play Guy."" No dates appear on the issues and the Eberles rarely attach their names, referring to themselves as ""The L.A. Star Family.""

The Eberles were the distributors of Finger and several other underground magazines, says Donald Smith, a sergeant with the obscenity section of the Los Angeles Police Department's vice division who followed the couple for years. LAPD was never able to prosecute for child pornography: ""There were a lot of photos of people who looked like they were under age but we could never prove it."" The pictures of young children in Finger are illustrations, and child pornography laws were less rigid a decade ago than they are today.

""Sexpot at Five,"" ""My First Rape, She Was Only Thirteen,"" and ""What Happens When Niggers Adopt White Children"" are some of the articles that appeared in Finger. One letter states: ""I think it's really great that your mags have the courage to print articles &amp; pixs [sic] on child sex... Too bad I didn't hear from more women who are into child sex... Since I'm single I'm not getting it on with my children, but I know of a few families that are. If I were married &amp; my wife &amp; kids approved–I'd be having sex with my daughters.""

Another entry reads: ""I'm a pedophile &amp; I think its [sic] great a man is having sex with his daughter!...Since I didn't get Finger #3, I didn't get to see the stories &amp; pics of family sex. Would like to see pics of nude girls making it with their daddy, but realize its too risky to print.""

It is truly fascinating how 'compromised' the leading debunkers of ritual abuse are.

277,It's terrifying what the FDA and Big Pharma are doing to our supplements,"&gt;FDA Turned Your $10 Supplement into a $40,000 Drug

by ANH USA

Earlier this year, we told you about an FDA back-channel that allows drug companies to turn supplements into drugs—and remove the supplement versions from the market. This has happened to a popular and medically important version of vitamin B6 (pyridoxamine), and with the FDA’s approval of a new drug to treat sickle cell anemia, the same could happen to L-glutamine.

Unless we close a back-channel at the FDA, more and more supplements will be turned into expensive drugs, and consumers won’t be able to manage their health cheaply and naturally with the supplement versions.

Last year, the FDA announced the approval of Endari, a drug for sickle cell disease. Endari is an oral powder comprised of L-glutamine, an important amino acid currently available as a supplement.

The drug company, Emmaus Medical, Inc., filed an investigational new drug (IND) application—demonstrating their investigation of L-glutamine as a drug—on May 15, 1997.

This is important because there is no new dietary ingredient (NDI) notification for L-glutamine. (Think of an NDI notification as a “new supplement” notification; by law an NDI notification must be filed on supplements that came to market after 1994.)

Enter the FDA back-channel. If a drug company begins investigating a nutrient for use in a drug before a supplement company files an NDI notification on that nutrient, the company can ask the FDA to have supplement version removed from the market, leaving consumers with no other option than the drug.

Currently, a 120-pill bottle of L-glutamine can be purchased for less than $10; a year’s worth of Endari will reportedly cost consumers more than $40,000.

If Emmaus enforces its IND, the only way that L-glutamine supplements could survive is if the FDA decides that L-glutamine was in the market “in or as” a supplement before 1994.

To make matters worse, the FDA has not completed its policy that lets companies know what is and isn’t grandfathered, or even how to file an NDI notification.

Given how the current draft of the FDA’s proposal is written, there’s even a real danger that supplements most people would think of as “grandfathered” could require NDI notifications.

All of this creates confusion that only helps drug companies further exploit this back-channel.

CBD oil faces a similar threat. For years, consumers have benefitted from access to cheap, safe, and effective CBD oil supplements.

But now the FDA says that CBD is a drug, not a supplement—a drug which will be sold for $32,500 a year.

While the FDA has not removed CBD oil supplements from the market yet, FDA’s declaration indicates it may be only a matter of time.

Until we close down the IND back channel that allows Big Pharma to turn supplements into drugs, we will continue to see this happen. There’s too much money to be made.

That’s why ANH is advocating for a legislative change that will protect natural substances from being turned into drugs by eliminating the market exclusivity that drug companies get when a new drug investigation is on a dietary ingredient currently being sold in the market in a dietary supplement.

These rules should apply retroactively to protect CBD oil, pyridoxamine, L-glutamine, and other substances that have already (or are likely to be) removed before this legislation becomes law.

Action Alert! Write to Congress and urge them to close the FDA back-channel that turns nutrients into expensive drugs. Please send your message immediately.

&gt;“The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else. —Eliezer Yudkowsky, research fellow, Machine Intelligence Research Institute”

&gt;Within the next 50 or 100 years, an AI might know more than the entire population of the planet. At that point, will control almost every connected device on the planet — will somehow rise in status to become more like a god, according to the leading experts on the future of artificial intelligence.

&gt;What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence? Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful – possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.

&gt;But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?

&gt;Bostrom says artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds — within this century, research suggests, a computer AI could be as “smart” as a human being. And then, says Bostrom, it will overtake us: “Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.” A philosopher and technologist, Bostrom asks us to think hard about the world we’re building right now, driven by thinking machines. Will our smart machines help to preserve humanity and our values — or will they have values of their own?

&gt;In the video below, MIT physicist and cosmologist Max Tegmark rightly emphasizes that the real problem is with the unforeseen consequences of developing highly competent AI. Artificial intelligence need not be evil and need not be encased in a robotic frame in order to wreak havoc. In Tegmark’s words, “the real risk with artificial general intelligence isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble.”

&gt;Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown says that AI and global consciousness will emerge to replace our human concept of the divine. “Humanity no longer needs God but may with the help of artificial intelligence develop a new form of collective consciousness that fulfills the role of religion.”

&gt;Brown made the provocative remark at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he was promoting his novel, ‘Origin,’ inspired by the question ‘Will God survive science?’, said Brown, adding that this had never happened in the history of humanity. ‘Are we naïve today to believe that the gods of the present will survive and be here in a hundred years?’ asks Brown in the video above.

&gt;SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, believes that we’ll conjuring up demons with AI superintelligence that could doom the human species.

&gt;Way ahead of either Bostrom or Dan Brown, Susan Schneider of the University of Connecticut and the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton is one of the few thinkers—outside the realm of science fiction— that have considered the notion that a super form of artificial intelligence is already out there, and has been for eons.

293,"They're not trying to suppress Thanksgiving because they want us to forget about a putatively racist event. What they want us to forget about is the definitive test of communism vs. free markets, which they have suppressed for out entire lives.","(copied from my article [Communism vs. Free Markets at Plymouth Rock](http://endofinnocence.com/communism-free-markets-plymouth-rock-jamestown/))

I learned from an article entitled [Our Forefather’s Failure](http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_March_2010.pdf) (at [LibertyUnbound.com](http://www.libertyunbound.com/)) that the colonies at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown tried both free-market and communist systems—long before Karl Marx was born.

The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in December 1620, and in spite of help from the Native Americans, half of them died the first year as a result of their initial system. During the second year, more of them died. They would quickly learn that their initial system was tragically incompatible with human nature. It was simply unnatural.

The colonists had the ideal conditions for their initial system because they all had a reputation as virtuous hard working people, they were all of the same race, religion, politics, and nationality; and of course, they all had agreed to this system voluntarily. They also knew that failure meant death.

Nevertheless, under their initial system, they simply weren’t producing and storing enough food, which lead to starvation, disease, and discontent. Their first solution, in their second year, was to institute beatings for those who did not work hard enough, but this had little effect on productivity, and it further increased discontent.

The colonists astutely observed that their system tended to retard productivity while breeding confusion and discontent. We know this because they wrote about it in their journals. Clearly, their initial system was incompatible with human nature.

By the spring of 1623 the Pilgrims feared they would not survive another winter, so in desperation, they adopted a radically different system, and it saved their lives. Productivity increased, and in 1623, they didn't have just another harvest feast—they had the first real Thanksgiving.

Which system failed the colonists initially, and which radically different system saved them? Which system was so incompatible with human nature, and which system was so compatible with human nature? Which system was so ugly, and which system was so beautiful?

According to their original governing document, the Mayflower Compact, they shared everything produced by any one of them—from each according to his ability—to each according to his need. The result was that only a small percentage of them worked hard, and the rest were freeloaders to varying degrees because they would rather risk death than be exploited by others. They were so reluctant to work that they even left food rotting on the vine! The result was indeed death. Half of them died! This reminds me of the saying by the people of the USSR, “They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.”

Then, in the spring of 1623, the surviving colonists decided to let each person keep the fruits of his labor, and the colony’s total output increased so much that they were never hungry again.

The governor wrote in his journal that under their initial (communist) system that some of them claimed to be too sick to work, and they were so convincing that it would have been the height of tyranny to force them work. Then, after they learned they could keep the fruits of their labor, those who were too sick to walk suddenly recovered and began working the fields!

Communism was killing the colonists at Plymouth Rock, and by switching to a free market system, they became more productive and saved themselves—in a single growing season.

The transition from communism to free markets still lacked full property rights however. Whereas each individual owned the fruits of his labor, he did not own the land he worked, and thus he did not own any improvements he made to that land.

In 1623, the colonists were still growing food on parcels of land that were reassigned by random lots each year, which they astutely observed was a disincentive for each farmer to make permanent improvements to his parcel of land because in the following year, someone else would inherit the fruits of any labor he devoted to improvements. Therefore, in 1624, they adopted full property rights where everyone owned the land he worked, and the result was another productivity boost. Whereas, the first step toward property rights and the free market increased productivity enough to feed everyone, the move to full property rights produced enough extra food to export and trade for furs and other goods.

The article goes on to explain the similar experience in Jamestown:

&gt;Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in America, established in Virginia in 1607, had an experience similar to the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Early years of starvation were followed by converting to a system of property rights and a free market, which brought abundance. Under collectivism, less than half of every shipload of settlers survived the first 12 months at Jamestown. Most of the work was done by only one-fifth of the men, to whom the socialist system gave the same rations as to the others. During the winter of 1609–10, called “The Starving Time,” the population fell from 500 to 60.But when Jamestown converted to a free market, there was “plenty of food, which every man by his own industry may easily and doth procure,” wrote the colony secretary Ralph Hamor in 1614. Under the previous system, he said, “we reaped not so much corn from the labors of thirty men as three men have done for themselves now.”

The article didn’t mention the Roanoke colony, which just disappeared, and many speculate that they were killed by the Native Americans, but I think we can all deduce what *really* happened to them … They were killed by communism.

Although both my first hand experience and observations as well as my research and analysis have long since led me to conclude that the free market and property rights are superior to communism, I would have believed that communism could have worked in the case of the first American colonies because they had every advantage one could give communism. They had already unanimously agreed to communism. They all shared the same race, nationality, religion, political views, and economic views. Failure meant starvation, and slackers were beaten, but in spite of every advantage possible, communism was a catastrophic and systemic failure in the first American colonies.

Consider that the colonists at Plymouth Rock had no historical precedent on which to evaluate communism vs. the free market, and yet when communism failed them, they invented and adopted a complete free market system with full property rights in just two years.

In just four years, the colonists proved that that communism was a very unnatural and ugly thing, and that free-markets and property rights were a very natural and beautiful thing.

Our ancestors’ understanding of the superiority of the free market and property rights made us the dominant nation on earth; whereas, today we are rapidly losing that status. Americans have forgotten the hard won knowledge of our ancestors?

Consider that the Barack Obama had 400 years of additional historical precedent as well as a Harvard education, and yet he still doesn’t understand how the free market is superior to communism. He says that that when the government forcibly takes the fruits of your labor and gives it to others to “spread the wealth around”, then that’s “good for everybody”.

Those colonists at Plymouth Rock, who seem so much more in touch with reality than the President of the United States, remind me of small town Americans of my childhood. Of course, the President sees small town Americans as basically racists who have “antipathy toward those who are different” and who “cling to their guns and religion”.

Although, Barack Obama is a dilettante, whose image was [manufactured by the media](http://www.endofinnocence.com/2013/04/the-myth-of-obama-busted.html), [progressives](http://www.endofinnocence.com/2014/08/american-progressive-manifesto.html) have told me that he is right because communism in early America was too soon. They claim that it is not human nature to be a freeloader and that the people themselves have learned a lot since then and would no longer be freeloaders. In case anyone cannot see that the progressive argument is BS, then consider that [the Danish recently proved that 90% still prefer to be freeloaders when they can](http://www.endofinnocence.com/2010/12/unemployment-benefits-myths-and-reality.html)—even when they can make more money working.",conspiracy,1542849943,JimAtEOI,6,1,True,2018-11-21

Jaws then tries to (spoilers, I guess) kill Bond by chewing through a cable car wire and riding a cable car to crush him. When Jaws crashes into a building, Dolly comes to the rescue. Jaws smiles and she likes him. That's it.

325,I have to post this theory - Donald Trump is a time traveller?,"This has been on my mind for such a long time. Watching youtube videos has only fueled it.

Before you say ""be gone you crazy conspiracy person"", let me just state some things and you can come to your own conclusion.

1. One of the people that worked on the Back to the Future films (movies about time travel) stated that the character Biff Tanner was based off of Donald Trump! 
2. Doanld Trump's uncle somehow got access to Nicoli Tesla's technology. Could he have made plans for a time machine. Its not too far fetched to think that trump with his vast fortune could have built a time machine. Plus many prominent scientists say that time travel is possible. 
3. He ran for President - could it be he knew in advance that he would win? eg travel to the future and discover he had won
4. During the campaign he came with so many catchy three word slogans. It was almost as if he knew to say those things. Also when he asked during a debate a tricky question about how he treats women, he masterfully turned it into a joke by mentioning Roise Odonnel and having the audience laugh. Who else could have done that?
5. When it came to 9/11 a he time he spoke about things as if he knew in adavance how it happened.
6. Things such as Pizzagate he seemed to know about it before it was even a thing.
7. He spoke about issues with the NY attorney general long before he got into trouble. 
8. people are worried the trade war with China will end in disaster and yet he doesnt seem to have a care in the world, as if he knows that iy will all turn out great.
9. The same thing with Saudia Arabia. 
10. On twitter calling his enemies names, as if he knows there will be no conseqences. does he know he will win again in 2020?

&amp;#x200B;

By the way its worth noting that Trump's running for President was 'prophecied' in the Simpsons in a scene where he travels down the escalator.

----

The weak-minded people who plague this world in their billions, will go to hell for their evil; people whom disrupt our natural creative and logical productivity, and thrive off of lowly insulting like grunts, are a great evil that will experience burning sensations in a lucid state as they pass - only then to get used to a new life that's a harsh degrade from their former.

The evil groups manage to keep an illusion of them being intellectual by rote educating their personalities in front of young minds and moderators, who support their depressive natures, with ignorance or immunity, are part of the problem.

In short, their behaviour is a crime because minds produce anyway regardless of your input, and what they teach with their poor example is restricting our minds to their kind of thought, which is a false government ideology. Several years ago these people were 'teachers pet's ' and in the present they are a forced, perverse meme.

Again they will burn and then become flies who dangle their tongues around dung; further, call them 'ooga booga' and move on, continue theorizing, abstractly sometimes, and continue trying to discuss and debate with people like me who care for your effort.

I seen a brutish man walk out of time last night and his expression was as if to say "" I'm full , I have talked a lot of shit, I'm full "", and children are taught to see this character as scary or cool, many of these perverts read this thread and flinch slightly in their perversity or prepare to engage again using metaphorically, the 'clothes of our youth', or the 'clothes of good.'

It's disgusting, I feel sorry for the young and aspiring minds who are doing a great job with their own theory while others distract them for petty pleasure.

Here’s my uneducated question. If a company with sinister motives wanted to start a VPN would they themselves have access to your information or are they blocked from all that as well?

If I haven’t had a direct experience with a highly evolved technology, I would have never believed such claims for any reason. And even after I having had this experience, it took a couple of days for me to digest the fact that this is real, there’s a highly evolved technology out there. Not only that this bizarre experience literally challenged me to rethink my fundamental beliefs about the world in a way that I have never expected. So I started deeply researching into various fields, fields including neuroscience, future physics, ancient stone structures, specifically the Giza Pyramids, ancient advanced knowledge, our religions, ancient high-tech tool marks, mental illnesses, demonic possessions and various other phenomena like channeling of alien beings, channeling of deceased people, dancing mania, witchcraft etc.. to make sense of the world and end of the day, I came to a conclusion that the highly evolved technology belongs to a group of human beings on Earth and your destiny has been planned long ago than you can possibly imagine. Unless a person carries out a massive research with an open mind and gains the right knowledge and the right worldview, such a conclusion will not make sense to another human being.

&amp;#x200B;

We must be careful in judging the historical books and events blindly, since it can be manipulated. We must not blindly trust what our eyes are seeing, what we hear, our sensations or any other experience that we have, cause highly evolved technologies can replicate those experiences by directly stimulating your brain using neuro/psychotronic weapons that use AI-based applications. A neuro/psychotronic weapon can be deployed through a global satellite grid to target any human being on Earth. Such weapons will have capabilities to stimulate human brains precisely and decode our perceptions in real time. Which means, these highly advanced satellites will be able to interact with human brains in a way that you have never imagined before, such as superimposing images into your visual cortex and manipulate your vision in real time (how about seeing bigfoot? or extremely tall human beings? humanoids? virtual friends? abnormal beings that you have never seen in real life? demons? shadow people? reptiles? basically any image can be superimpose to your visual cortex), stimulate your auditory cortex and speak to you, stimulate your somatosensory cortex and induce sensations to you, induce smells by stimulating olfactory cortex or even change your level of consciousness(trans mind-state) by suppressing very unique neural activities of your brain. Not only that a highly advanced satellite-based neuro/psychotronic weapon can map AI’s even to human bodies and control bodies remotely. When such conditions are possible in the world, the experiences that we have throughout our lifetime, the knowledge that we accumulate through our senses, we must critically and carefully analyze prior making an assertion. Sometimes, one wrong assertion would be enough to spoil our whole life. That being said, out of these two, one thing must materialize in the coming days, either sudden events will destroy human lives in a massive scale, a scale beyond belief or you will understand the truth that I’m exposing. And this must take place within months to 10 years time.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s true that a highly evolved technology is out there, not being able to understand this complicated truth, we have been ridiculing our fellow human beings for quite a long time, however, I must say that these unidentified flying objects or extremely advanced flying machines and its related phenomena are actually a humongous crime against humanity that is being committed by a group of human beings who are living in Switzerland today.

&amp;#x200B;

There has been an extremely advanced global society way back in the past. Pharaohs, who built the great Pyramid of Giza, are a family who has been living in this highly advanced global society. However, to keep the ruling of the Earth under their families, through strategically engineered events, they have depopulated the world and through these events they have managed to put us(all the nations) into stone age whilst keeping the technology within their families. Thereafter, using this mind-boggling, extremely advanced technology, they (their descendants) have been running an invisible rule on Earth. The satellites that this highly advanced global civilization has been having is mind-boggling too, this wouldn’t be possible without these satellites. These highly advanced / extremely sophisticated surveillance satellites are still operating in our skies. These satellites are monitoring brain activities of human beings 24/7. It could manipulate your perceptions in real-time or even map AI’s to your brain and control your bodily activities (We have self driving cars but what about human bodies that is driven by AI’s, whilst our minds are in an unconscious state? What happens if they map AI’s to top positions of your government/military personnel and control major decisions?). For example, it could stimulate your visual cortex and make you see a person though that person is actually not in front of you and you would not know what’s real and what’s manipulated. Today there are so many people around the world who are claiming that since childhood they have been talking to virtual friends(only that particular individual can see these beings), these beings are not real, the reason for you to see these people/beings are due to highly advanced AI-based programs that stimulate your visual cortex directly and superimposing these information/images to your brain. Some of you could be also interacting with these virtual beings thinking that those are real beings. This technology could replicate or replay any neural activity that you have in your brain through satellites, therefore, these satellites are extremely powerful. Again, there’s a complicated reasoning behind this claim and I URGE you to take this WARNING SERIOUSLY and give your UTMOST ATTENTION to research and understand the truth behind UFOs and its related phenomena without a delay. Our enemy is not Iran, Russia, China, Israel, US, UK or any other country it’s these families. We have never had a contact with aliens, it’s a deception only. You have interacted with genetically modified beings.

Following is a conversation that Billy Meier is having with these people on Earth, however, they have deceived Billy Meier to think that aliens are communicating with him. This is not aliens, human beings are behind this crime! Though they mentioned that the monitoring disc has been removed from the skies, this global satellite grid is still operating in our skies.

Someone could say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, however, it is just a bunch of words only, let’s be realistic, if someone uses a technology that is 1000+ years or 10000+ years ahead of ours to commit a crime, is it possible for us to prove it unless we giving an extraordinary effort?Is it possible for us to understand and classify a particular phenomenon as a crime against humanity with our current scientific understanding? That said, let me unfold the complicated story of the planet Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of important points of the article:**

* Anecdotal Evidence For the Existence Of the Phenomenon. Highly educated and intelligent people are coming forward to expose the truth today.
* Is it possible to hide an advanced technology on Earth? Yes, it’s entirely possible, we just need to master 3 things only.
* Is it possible to remove the evidence for the existence of highly advanced global societies from the face of the Earth? Yes, it’s entirely possible, again, we just need to master 3 things only. A reply that a theoretical physicist and a neuroscientist would understand. After all, this is a mind-boggling technology, and the related phenomena cannot be understood by every human being on Earth, experts in neuroscience, theoretical physics, and other experts must dig into the issue without a delay. These people must be open minded and trust pure logic, not beliefs.
* Which means, this could be a technology that belongs to a group of human beings on Earth? Yes, that’s correct and that’s the truth. Which also means, they are secretly ruling the world for quite a long time using their high-tech toys and that’s why the UFO phenomenon can be traced back to ancient times too. Not only that this is why an extremely high number of yearly UFO activities on Earth.
* Which means, the perpetrators behind the UFO phenomenon are trying to establish the ET visitation belief among human beings? That’s correct, by using a highly evolved technology, it’s quite easy to establish such a belief in human beings. From a highly evolved technological standpoint, we only need genetically modified beings and 2 high-tech toys to establish this belief in human beings and roam the Earth freely using their extremely advanced machines. And this has raised the unidentified flying object phenomenon in the world.
* So extraterrestrial beings (ET’s) visitation is a deception? A misunderstanding? A false claim? Yes, that’s correct, we could further analyze the following hypothesis to make sense of this further.  

   * Extraterrestrial Hypothesis
   * Terrestrial Hypothesis
* The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis. Its related phenomena are a carefully constructed narrative to deceive the society.
* The Terrestrial Hypothesis. A staggering amount of evidence is in plain sight but we must think out of the box to understand the evidence that supports the terrestrial hypothesis.

1). Extremely high number of UFO-related activities per year. Clues for the use of high-tech toys on a daily basis by a group of human beings on Earth.

2). The UFO phenomenon can be traced back to ancient times. A clue that a group of human beings using the technology for quite a long time on Earth.

3). From a highly evolved technological standpoint, UFO-related phenomena show the existence of a highly advanced neuro/psychotronic weapon that is being deployed through a global satellite grid on Earth and the existence of these satellites can be traced back to ancient times too. Think about this way, UFO researchers are claiming that they are capable of accessing our most secured computer systems too, which means, they must have developed highly advanced applications. If they have developed such applications, can they develop applications to interact with our brains? If so what are those applications? Have they developed mind-control applications? Can we identify those? Is it in plain sight? That said, following is a list of identifiable applications of this highly advanced technology out there. Mind control technology is actually there on Earth. UFOs are just the tip of the ICEBERG.

&amp;#x200B;

I). The missing time phenomenon  
II). Alien beings channeling phenomenon  
III). Deceased people channeling phenomenon  
IV). Multiple personality (dissociative identity) phenomenon. This is a quite new phenomenon and it’s history goes back to 15th century only. A personality reflecting sophisticated human actions cannot be seen prior to the 15th century in MPD/DID cases  
V). Psychic/Paranormal phenomena  
VI). Automatic writing phenomenon  
VII). Remote viewing phenomenon  
VIII). Synesthesia phenomenon (mapping of senses and manipulation of senses in real-time)  
IX). “Targeted Individuals” phenomenon  
X). The voice of God phenomenon  
XI). Prophets and the Prophetic phenomenon

*(This evidence is not yet recognized. When you closely look into the above cases, you would understand that these cases are due to a mind-boggling AI-based applications only. A global satellite grid has been deployed to create these phenomena on Earth and this grid monitors brain activities of human beings 24/7. Is there an element of truth behind the all-seeing eye? or is it just a myth? Have you ever wonder why UFO encounters are experiencing paranormal and psychic experiences? This article should give you an insight. We have been ridiculing our fellow human beings for making claims with regard to UFOs and we have been ridiculing another group of human beings for making claims with regard to a technology that’s able to control human minds. After all, we have been referring to a highly evolved technology. What could be the ultimate truth?* *)*

4). Highly advanced knowledge can be seen in some unique ancient books clearly supporting the terrestrial hypothesis.

5). A ton of evidence can be seen in ancient stone structures revealing an advanced knowledge and an advanced technology supporting the terrestrial hypothesis.

&amp;#x200B;

* Other supporting evidence for the terrestrial hypothesis.
* The Crop circle phenomena, its connections to UFOs and ancient Egypt .
* Who are the perpetrators and where do they stay?
* Final thoughts &amp; the future of humanity.

This article should give you an insight. We have been ridiculing our fellow human beings for making claims with regard to UFOs and we have been ridiculing another group of human beings for making claims with regard to a technology that’s able to control human minds. After all, we have been referring to a highly evolved technology. What could be the ultimate truth?* *)*

4). Highly advanced knowledge can be seen in some unique ancient books clearly supporting the terrestrial hypothesis.

5). A ton of evidence can be seen in ancient stone structures revealing an advanced knowledge and an advanced technology supporting the terrestrial hypothesis.

The universe is fair, which is a form of balance, it is above the world because both it and the world have produced a fair state and existence. The world is above the universe and it is fair, because the planet is a geoid it can harvest experience - which brings new meaning to the phrase fair is square.

Agenda 21/ 30 is happening right before our eyes. They are desperate so they aren't even trying to hide their moves anymore. Truthfully humanity is waking up FAST, and they know they can't do anything to stop this, but they sure are trying. In this there is a silver lining.

Ironic, isn't it?","First off, I'm not even sure if posting this sort of thing is allowed, but let it be known to all of those who come into this post being very cautious that I'm not going to put a link to the actual video (If I can, maybe someone can let me know), otherwise I just have two screenshots (on SFW and the other NSFW) that literally says everything that needs to be said.

&amp;#x200B;

It does feature two women above the age of 18, so I think it's alright but on the off chance I can't for whatever reason, I'm going to wait until definite approval to put the links to the screenshots.

\-

So I think being on Reddit, we can all agree that we've been to various porn websites now and again for whatever reasons. And that's fine. We're human. When we don't have a partner at the moment, where else we gonna go? Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I was doing this exact thing a couple of days when I came across what looked to be a usual type of video that I would be interested in.  Girl on girl. Right off the thumbnail, I noticed something odd. Did I really want to believe that there was a bloody face/mask in the video? Pointed right at the camera, no less?  Indeed, that's what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really couldn't believe it. The backdrop/setting for the shoot seemed to be a woman's bedroom. More leaning towards a younger woman's bedroom. Why would that be there?

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do we have a bloody face/mask to the left behind the actresses but we also have what appears to be an art piece on the right depicting what seems to be naked babies beating each other up. And one of them seems to be holding a weapon (or a body part, I think??) I really don't want to go into that specific point too much. It gets me nauseous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from these two things, there's also two more art pieces on the walls in the video. A headless man, carrying his own creepily laughing head in his arms. And the other is literally, just a small portrait of the devil, himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've described what's in the shot, we have to talk about what's going to happen to the person who decides that this is the right video to get off on. I'm not really good with scientific and technical jargon, so stick with me as much as you can here. Even though the person watching is obviously not staring at the items around the main shot, but is watching the women go at it, let's think about Peripheral vision for a moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have nude babies, violence, blood, dismemberment, a vile and disgusting sense of humor and literally the devil himself. All while you're feeling a sense of pleasure. So, in the mind, whether you like it or not - you are connecting pleasure with dark and disturbing things.

So, Gina Haspel while in Ankara, somehow ""signaled"" to ""somebody"" that they have a recording of a phone call by MBS giving the order to silence Khashoggi as soon as possible.

Meanwhile the CIA has not responded or made a comment on this article because they ""rarely talk about their activities""...that's funny, because the CIA has been pretty frickin talkative about the Khashoggi case lately. Why?

More and more it looks like Khashoggi was the CIA's operative.

Assuming the article is accurate, big assumption at this point, I do have some questions. 

One, did Haspel play that recording for Trump? If not, why?

Two, who did Haspel signal in Ankara?

Three, did Haspel have Trump's approval to do it?

Personally, this represents one more red flag in the Khashoggi case if the article is legitimate.

It will be interesting to see who defends Haspel on this. As far as I can recall, the majority of users on this sub vigorously disagreed with her appointment.

468,Are vegetarian and vegan diets being pushed down to the populace is a way for TPTB to subtly sublimate the population?,"I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I'm a meat eater myself and I feel quite masculine and physically fit for myself. But I did try a vegan or vegetarian diet before. It definitely made me change to the extend that I was not nearly as aggressive and was more ""feminine"" in my demeanor and mental thoughts. I felt a higher sense of well being but I feel like I'm floating along in life. Whereas when I eat meat or even go on a pure carnivore diet, I feel a lot more aggressive and fearless, but I always have a desires to be pushing. Aka, I'm never content. I am not talking about eating Chicken McNuggets by the way, I literally mean just steak beef and eggs with unsalted butter kinda thing.   


I've been seeing quite a lot of ""grassroots"" pushes for vegetarian and vegan diets, and 90% of the time its guys who are particularly effeminate or obviously hippie flippie women. And I notice most of those couples tend to slide towards the androgynous scale, lowering fertility and testosterone production in men...

&amp;#x200B;

I won't lie I smoked a doobie but I definitely think that pure carnivore diet is actually a hidden gem towards becoming a high performing male in our society. I know many here are not fans, but Jordan Peterson had spoken about the pure carnivore diet to Joe Rogan and that's what truly made me realize what my mood changes were related to.

480,Mind control is real.,"I've posted this before...the gang stalking phenomenon is part of massive psychological operation, supposed treatment for psychological disorders.  Unfortunately, that means whatever the mental health professionals believe and want from you goes without question.  They don't care who you are. They just want to make you ""functional"". They don't care what you believe as long as you think, love, feel, and live as they want you to.  Nothing's up for debate.  

Love is not a game. Marriage is not a necessity.  Life is not a game and we don't have to ""win"" anything.  They're content keeping us that way though.  As long as we live that way, they're happy.  The whole PUA crap is part of this.  Read the book Amusing Ourselves To Death by Neil Postman.  Our entire society is founded on assumptions like ""Love should be fun"". ""Love your career"", ""Live the Life"", ""Buy your happiness"", ""Make it funny""

Love is about connection.

Anyway, I  went on a tangent.  These people say these operations are based purely on hypnosis. I'm not sure if that's the case.  Various sub-reddits function as honeypots as well.  These include the red pill, and the mgtow subreddits.  They're judging men and violating them against their will and then luring them to these sub reddits.  

If you look at the content you can see things like ""blah blah blah""... it sounds like minor thing, but it's a sign of what they do. It's one of the subliminal messages they put in their targets mind.

Additionally, allegedly, they treat ""toxic shame"".  I'm not sure entirely.  There is also the possibility that put in numerous destructive subliminal, so that the ""real person"" comes out.  If the person truly is the ""chauvscum"" they'll flip out, or lose it or adopt toxic beliefs, the idea that those subliminals were merely suggestions and they deserve to act on them. 

This is a very real conspiracy and it's part of large scale operation. They are violating people and ""removing them from reality"" with some form of dissociation.",conspiracy,1542938413,weebz123,6,1,True,2018-11-22

0,Anyone else stunned by the strikingly different reactions and responses to the disappearance of Khashoggi compared to the chief of Interpol?,"These two situations are obviously very different and involve entirely different state actors, but something is *not* sitting right with me here.

The sketchy [Deep State connections to Khashoggi](https://gizadeathstar.com/2018/10/the-forgotten-khashoggi-connection/) aside (ie his friendship with Osama bin Laden), I found it shocking how the disappearance of Interpol chief Meng Hongwei was reported by the Mockingbird MSM, along with all of the outrageously suspicious details, but then they literally would move on to the next story in the same breath.

Just to make sure I have this timeline right, Interpol Chief Meng Hongwei sent a cryptic text message of a dagger to his wife ([who believes he's dead](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/19/interpol-ex-chief-may-be-dead-wife-fears-after-capture-by-chinese)), was arrested in China for undisclosed reasons, and then it was rather unceremoniously announced that he ""retired"" from his position, and he hasn't been seen since (!!).

In what bizarro universe can this be reported as ""yet another story"" and then largely forgotten?

In what bizarro universe can a reporter disappear under similarly suspicious circumstances, and then *that* creates an international incident?

Granted, Khashoggi being a ""journalist"" certainly caused more interest among the MSM, but are we really living in a world where you can be the *head of an international law enforcement agency* and you can be kidnapped and ""disappeared"" without the global population so much as batting an eye?

This by no means is meant to downplay the increasingly likely culpability of Saudi Arabia in the death of Khashoggi, but why does China get a free pass? 

Does China have to kidnap and murder a Deep State journalist before the Mockingbird Media actually pays attention?

For those who are all of the sudden ""outraged"" by Saudi Arabia over this incident, where have you been as KoA continues its genocidal campaign in Yemen using US weaponry? ",conspiracy,1540133834,axolotl_peyotl,62,1,True,2018-10-21

8,"The Apollo 20 / ""Mona Lisa"" hoax - repost","Sorry folks, didn't have my ducks in a row when I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9pvx23/the_apollo_20_mona_lisa_hoax/ and I was kind of incoherent and assuming this was a Well Known hoax.

This hoax came out in 2007 and it purported to tell the story of a secret [Apollo 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_20_hoax) mission, designed to examine various structures like a ruined city and an abandoned spacecraft on the Moon.

It also purported to show a ""hibernating"" female alien being examined in the Lunar Module, who gained the Internet nickname ""Mona Lisa"". While the whole thing has been [debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amRcbMmXTDY), one thing just gives me the heebie-jeebies to this day, and that is the detail in the hoax version of the Lunar Module. Years ago, the example of an exhibited LM I was checking with had no equipment in the centre bay, so I couldn't work out how the hoax LM looked more complete.

I still have a problem with the level of detail in the hoax LM - example in the [Mona Lisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C15fEsICmg) vid at 00:50 and other. Compared to the Smithsonian exhibit, slide 14/55 [here](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lunar-module-2-apollo), the control panels are almost exact - a couple of switches relocated here and there as one might find in a design revision, but 90% the same. As in, exactly the same. As in, uh?

So, how? And, why? I mean, mocking up the LM to that level, ocd level, would take serious time and probably money. The alleged hoaxer is an artist and sculptor - guys like him are perpetually broke. 

I just can't get my head round this. Are the LM scenes real, with the rest of the story a load of tosh?

The Jesuits, who are huge anti-gun proponents, have positioned politicians who they have trained into government offices to advocate for gun control such as Mitch Landrieu, former President of the United States Conference of Mayors who is a member of Everytown for Gun Safety which organization was started by Catholic Thomas Menino and pro-Catholic Jew Michael Bloomberg. In general, Catholic countries have the strictest gun control laws in the western world.

Close to half of the Presidents of the United States Conference of Mayors have been Catholic. It was created by FDR who started the military government in 1933, confiscated the gold of all Americans, and transformed the office of the President to the office of the military conqueror under the advisory of the Jesuit Edmond Walsh.

The Cochrane review found that there are no good quality studies done after 1975 that actually support fluoridation. Studies exist to support that fluoridated toothpaste is effective in reducing tooth decay, but ingesting fluoride is unnecessary and ineffective at reducing tooth decay which is why fluoridation is ineffective. Yet, the CDC, ADA and all these other “health” organizations claim there’s so many studies that show fluoridation is “safe and effective.” Does no one find it bizarre that this practice is allowed to continue when the evidence supporting it is lousy and when there’s evidence showing possible links to a variety of ill health effects such as hypothyroidism, osteosarcoma in young boys, ADHD, low IQ in children etc.

75% of the US is fluoridated and it is actually absurd how difficult it is politically to get  fluoridation chemicals out of the water. Alongside the US, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand have the majority consuming  fluoridated water.

32,"From the new book ""How to End the Autism Epidemic""","From the book --

#  [How to End the Autism Epidemic](https://www.amazon.com/How-Autism-Epidemic-J-B-Handley/dp/1603588248).

&gt;***“I also find, with a high degree of medical certainty, that the set of immunizations administered to Yates at age 11 months while he was ill was the immediate cause of his autistic regression because of the effect of these immunizations to further impair the ability of his weakened mitochondria to supply adequate amounts of energy for the brain, the highest-energy consuming tissue in the body.”***  
 —Dr. Richard Kelley, Professor of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University (Kennedy Krieger Institute)1

There are only a few people in the world I believe could end the [**autism**](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/autism-spectrum-disorders)  epidemic single-handedly. The director of the CDC would be one, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics probably another. Dr.  Andrew Zimmerman, the former director of medical research at the prestigious Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins University, would be the third.

For years Dr. Zimmerman served as a go-to expert in “vaccine court” to dispute parental claims that vaccines caused their children’s autism.  And as the reigning national expert on the topic of autism in the scientific community, Dr. Zimmerman’s opinions held tremendous weight:  His written testimony helped deny the claims of the families of more than five thousand children with autism during an Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2009 in vaccine court, as I will explain in a moment.

In the late 1990s a young doctor fresh out of medical school joined the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore as a resident and worked closely with Dr. Zimmerman. His name was Jon Poling. In 2000 Dr. Poling’s nineteen-month-old daughter, Hannah, experienced a massive  regression into autism after her [**vaccinations**](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all),  much as happened to my son. Unlike my son, Hannah’s parents had access to the most sophisticated autism research center in the world, and Dr.  Zimmerman and several of his colleagues, including Dr. Richard Kelley,  who was serving as director of Kennedy Krieger’s laboratory, tried to figure out what had happened to her, and why.

 

# Dr. Zimmerman on Children He Sees at Harvard 

**Lawyer:  You actually see children in your clinic daily, weekly, with autism  that has resulted from an underlying mitochondrial disorder?** 

*Dr. Zimmerman: Yes.* 

**Lawyer:  And when you see those children, you go about trying to figure out what  may have been the triggering event or the causative event of the  regressive autism?**

*Dr. Zimmerman: Yes.*

**Lawyer:  And in your practice you look at vaccines as one potential cause for a  regressive autism in a child—for children like Yates?** 

*Dr. Zimmerman: Potential, yes. And then we—we’re trying very hard to treat them.* 

Dr.  Zimmerman confirms that vaccines are on the table as a possible cause  of autism for all the children whom he sees. I also want to point out  that in reading Dr. Zimmerman’s entire deposition, I really saw his  humanity, and his honesty. He sees these children every day. Unlike  NeuroTribes’ Steven Silberman, Dr. Zimmerman isn’t romanticizing autism;  he knows how devastating a disability it is, for the affected kids and  their families. It’s clear he wants to help these children recover, and  to prevent children from developing regressive autism in the first  place.

38,Witness testimony of something fiahy going on in park,"￼
The red marker is for Mile High Campground which is the closest landmark to the newly revealed secret facility near the Blue Ridge Parkway between Cherokee and Maggie Valley, North Carolina.

Ex-military man exposes underground facility in national park
By Mary Joyce, website editor

We’ve heard reports, even before starting this website in 2008, about secret military activity in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Then on February 16, 2013, a credible witness with a military background spoke with two of us from the website about the secret activity.  For his privacy and protection, we have changed his name to “Clark.”  Throughout his testimony he used the word “we” to include his wife who often accompanied him.   She, too, once served in the military. 

Before revealing his information, Clark showed us the photo below which was taken on November 27, 2012 near the intersection of Highways 74 and 441 on the south side of Cherokee, NC.

￼

“This truck was driven by a female truck driver with whom we spoke,” Clark said.  “She said she wasn’t sure what was onboard but that it belonged to the U.S. Air Force.  She said she was waiting for five other trucks and an escort to take them to Newfound Gap where their loads would be airliftedto an undisclosed location. 

“While I was there, the other trucks arrived,” Clark said. “They all had canvas covers on them that said USAF (United States Air Force) on the side.  Then I saw the escorts arrive in white SUVs with government plates and the guys were dressed in black and carrying weapons.”

When we asked Clark what he thought was on the truck in the photo, he said, “I’ve seen something similar in the military. The dome-shaped thing on the back of the truck looks like a clean room that you walk into to be decontaminated.

“We followed those trucks, but at a distance,” Clark said.  “As soon as they went through the gate at Smokemont Campground just north of the Oconaluftee Visitor Center, the park rangers closed the gates and closed the park.”

￼

QUESTIONABLE ACTIVITY ON HEINTOOGA RIDGE ROAD

Next we handed Clark maps of the Blue Ridge Parkway and he focused on Heintooga Ridge Road.

“About three years ago they closed that road,” he said, “and it was closed for approximately two years.  The official line was that there had been a washout, but when we went back through there in the summer of 2012 after the road reopened, there were no signs anywhere of a washout, yet the road beyond the Mile High Campground had been 90 percent repaved.

“Now there was nothing wrong with the road before; it was in perfectly good shape, but they repaved it all the way to the end where it turns into a one-lane dirt or gravel road.”

Clark speculates that the road was damaged by heavy trucks hauling supplies and equipment to an underground facility and that was why the road had to be repaved.

“While we were on Heintooga Road,” Clark continued, “we saw four white SUVs with U.S. government plates.  Now all the forestry vehicles have the U.S. Forestry stickers on their doors.  These were just plain SUVs. We didn’t see anybody around the SUVs but they were parked near trail

62,How to take over America,"Step 1: Convince parents that incorporating their locally-controlled educational system into a rigid, federally-mandated curriculum is a good idea. (Common core, No child left behind, etc)

Step 2: Teach them all the same things, at the same ages, from the same books.

Step 3: Discourage independent thought for their entire childhood, while you slowly whittle away at what little remains of their individuality.

Step 4: Reward the most subservient and obedient kids with extra obedience training in the form of free ""advanced"" education. This can help destroy any semblance of confidence of those who didn't ""make the cut"", which prevents new corporate competition springing up for your friends, while also providing an extra benefit of ""advanced"" political brainwashing for the the ones you've invested the most energy into.

Step 5: Teach the most obedient of your ""highly educated"" adults that they are, for some reason or another, morally, intellectually, or otherwise, superior to the ""less educated"" through political mechanisms. 

Step 6: Create a generation of parents with no individuality, dreams, or goals of their own who actually took your propaganda bait hook, line, and sinker. Now, they'll spew it to their kids on your behalf the second they step foot in the home after a long day at indoctrination camp. (I.e. ""Look at that side, aren't they evil?"")

Step 7: Ostracize other portions of society with trendy and scary labels ('fringe', 'alt-culture', 'domestic terrorists') who may have ""differences"" with your authoritarianism, using your ""educational"" system, until the alienated populations feel their livelihoods are at stake. They will soon feel powerless to overcome the highly educated, and this will create spite between the newly divided society.

Step 8: The process is now fully automated! rinse, repeat, and adjust as necessary for optimal results. Civil war is probably a bit too bloody... the entire nation's sovereignty should suffice. 

...But people do seem to be afraid of civil war, so you could probably scare them with it for awhile, just until they give all their rights away! Unless it takes a little extra, ""persuasion"", of course.

Bonus step: Convince the ""lesser"" educated that they can still advance themselves through patriotism, and entice them with the reward of extra obedience training, but only if they deserve it by risking their life for the great nation that *really* controls them (hint: it's not theirs). That way, they might join your side instead of siding with the losers! Could always use a few more heads, right? And if not, you can use them exploit third-world countries for your corporate friends.

66,Hackers beware! The US government has an operation to send nanobots (powered by electrolytes) into your bloodstream to spread across your brain and mind control you,"The title is a basic summary of what this post is about. Mind control seems like something from a action or a scifi story that you can get lost in without consequence. But unfortunately, it is a very achievable and real thing in our current generation and it is being put to questionable use right now on select US civilian hackers by a secret US military operation. Hello, I'm Amy. And I've been collecting information and doing research on the technological side of their mind control and I write/share this with the hope that people will be better informed of it and can help me fight back (especially if they are being controlled by the government).

&amp;#x200B;

So the science of mind control in it's purest sense is the reading, disruption, and re-wiring of the complex system of the human brain. One transmits a thought or an action to a person's brain (we'll call the civilian, Person A) using either a computer or another person's brain (we'll call the government operative, Person B). If a computer system were to control Person A, it would usually be done with very specific pre-recorded actions/thoughts, optical distortions, or readjusting the lens of the eyes (they can calibrate it so it's very sharp) since they're not doable with a connection with a different person (aka Person B). Whereas, if Person B were to control Person A, any thought or action they perform would be transferred by low frequency radio waves to Person A's brain (so they would essentially copy Person B's thoughts/actions). 

&amp;#x200B;

The way that they do this however, is through nanotechnology, which has been around for awhile now. Tiny nano-robots are engineered to detect any electrical impulses that run through the neuron it's managed to attach themselves to and transmit a new electrical impulse when it's been triggered by Person B/the computer. This is the basis for the ""mind control"" and making Person A do as the nano-robots directed. Likewise, Person B can copy Person A's thoughts (hence reading their mind) and actions, which is what they usually do. However, the operation are very selective as to what Person A understands about the situation, so they don't allow Person A to be able to hear, see, or read the mind of Person B. However, they do communicate by moving Person A's vocal muscles and lungs. So they would communicate something like:

&amp;#x200B;

Person A: Why are you here?

&amp;#x200B;

Person B (speaking through Person A's mouth): I'm here to teach you things about telemetry, the reticular formation, transceivers, endothelial cells or similar things of that sort.

&amp;#x200B;

Person A (still conscious after seeing their mouth move on their own): I've never heard those things before. I suppose you're real...

&amp;#x200B;

Those are some of the things I've learned as Person A. My Person B consist of three different people who take shifts to engage me as their job. They usually speak like one another so I can't really tell who's who, but they are all women (like I am). Although I've been singled out for their operation, I'm not a hacker. I just found the wrong things at the wrong time online and have been followed by the government ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

As to how the nano-robots (which likely number to the millions-billions per person for the billions of neurons in the brain) get into the brain, they're likely get into the [bloodstream by ingestion or injection and get carried throughout the brain and into the blood-brain barrier](https://www.google.com/search?q=blood+vessels+in+brain&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHh66Uw5jeAhVWHTQIHduaAycQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1582&amp;bih=768). There, they probably covered the nano-robots with something the blood-brain barrier does allow through, [such as proteins or harmless, weaponized viruses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBKMArkvCT4) that carry the nano-robots to the neurons. If it isn't obvious yet, the form of the nanobot has a body for the battery and a claw that allows it to latch on the neuron and electrocute it very lightly.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that it's necessary to use a supercomputer when it comes to connecting two or more people because all the millions or billions of nano-robots that each person has that has to be connected to the other person. Each nano-robot is assigned an alpha-numeric ID so that neuronal pathways and wiring can be identified and essentially map out the person's brain. Every one of the nano-robots also either have 1) individual transmitting/receiving radio frequencies assigned to them or 2) have one frequency for all the nano-robots to react to to communicate with the receiving/transmitting supercomputers. There is a very, very, very slight delay-time because they have incredibly fast processors (they can sing on-time with a song I'm hearing). They likely also use satellite to send these transmissions back and forth between their base (which is likely military) and to my position (I've been to different states and they've always been able to communicate with me even during mid-flight). Also, I believe that the nano-robots are [powered by electrolytes](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/nanorobot3.htm) or glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or they may use thermal energy as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been unwillingly under their control for a few years now, but I think it would be good if they finally came out about it since it would further progress in health and science. They would probably have a lot of funding (although they would have to pay money to the civilian hackers they took under their control for stress and invasion of privacy). I'm being lenient because during the time I got to know and learn from them, they weren't too bad after awhile (plus, they're actually helping me too sometimes). I'm trying to force them out gently because nothing much will change unless I do something. Thank you for reading this and feel free to ask any questions. I left out a couple of details since I thought it would make this post too long (such as the dreams they give us, memory exploration, why I don't think it's parasites, etc.). I'm not sure if it'll work, but I've been trying to talk to the FBI about things so that I can meet up with the FCC and have them investigate the radio frequencies that'll come out from the nano-robots in my brain. If any one has any tips as to how I can proceed (especially with radio frequency), I'd love to hear it.

The program aims to “investigate the feasibility of creating safe and reliable autonomous software agents that can effectively counter malicious botnet implants and similar large-scale malware.” Essentially, DARPA wants to hack the hackers, without human involvement, and stop botnets before they attack.

128,How to become an artist,"How to become an artist

Life is an art, and an art well worth your learning. Life is art, art imitates life, life imitates television, television simulates death, and we are back to life, *ad nauseum*. It is all scale-invariant fractal repetitions of the same, over and over in so many different sets of naked clothing. 

So brushes up, motherfuckers, and let us peer through the canvas. We are not in Kansas anymore. 

It is difficult to know my audience now, as you all peer through black magic obelisks strapped to your hand like ankle monitors that always need to assess your faces for any random sparks of life. And so few seem to question any of this, history being memoryholed in my own lifetime (can you even *imagine* what else *they* have lied about?). Think of all that has been fed into the mnemonic sinkhole even in the past few months and you begin to get an idea of the pace of things. And while the pace of everything seems to be speeding up, time is speeding up; it is still worth slowing everything down into a manageable pace, as timing truly is *everything*. 

And all that time in front of magic screens has this tendency to *form* the viewer, after a fashion. Formable into something less formidable. You have been stamped out as a *consumer by definition*, first defined by what you consume, and eventually consumed by it. But you are oh so much more than any of that, and there is so much more than that to all of this. You are important, blessed as fuck and should really be blissed by all of this in-between dust and dust, if only you would notice it is passing as you swipe left on life. You are so much more than a consumer of the endless dross: you are *an artist*. 

There are so many things in this world which are kept separate only because if you saw the schematics side by side you would call one a rip-ff of the other. But it is all just scale-invariant fractal repetitions of the same, over and over, stamped out through the suburbs like dirtmalls or feedlots, endless drivel to serve one lot of cattle to another. But I am going to let you in on a little secret (I've peered behind the curtain myself): *they are all lying to you*.

Nothing is as complicated as it is presented. And there is always a *[spend money, cunt light](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/7cuuz7/spend_money_cunt/)* on everything to convince you get someone else more qualified to fix your shit. But really it is all just scale-invariant fractal repetitions of the same patterns, over and over. I do a number of things for [*my living*](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/74deqs/what_do_you_do_for_a_living/): I build and fix computers, I play guitar, I teach, I cut down trees, I fix cars, and lawn mowers and tractors and just about any kind of motor or engine, I build security systems, furniture, grow food, fist fight and skateboard. This is not meant as a cv, but this (rater insufficient) list is in litany for the sake of making my point: it is *all* scale-invariant fractal repetitions of the same. Same, same. 

Working back to front (as we presume to have passed the halfway point of our essay and have to resume the hourglass shape to show off those womanly hips), we can start with skateboarding. I'm thirty-nine in this day and age, but I have been skateboarding most of my life, less time for recovery, since I was about nine. I only got into drains and shit after I was twelve, but none of that is the point of this. It takes fucking ages to get anywhere in skating, to get *confident*. But really, it is all a series of simple actions, in the right order. 

I should probably get to the point of all of this; six hundred words in, I know you kids are not known for your attention spans these days. It is *all* very simple. Life is not as complex as you have been led to accept. It is all a series of simple steps to follow, with some simple rules to everything. *Everything* has a trick or two to it, but it is not the mystery school shit those mystery school types might have you think. Everything just has a few rules to it; and everything has *its own personality*. Beyond that, it is all *same same*. 

Back to skateboarding. You can pull off some pretty impressively complex looking shit with very little effort. It is all a series of small movements that you commit to muscle memory. And It is *all fucking timing*, but that applies *to everything*. But it all builds on itself, one series of small movements coupled with the next, and so on. But skateboarding has two things you *always* have to *pay attention* to: where your back shoulder is, and where your eyes are. 

I began fixing just about everything through necessity, but I am one of those people who *wants to know* how shit is put together, so I have a habit of taking everything apart. I've been building and fixing computers for some twenty years now. It is really not as complex as most people seem to think. It is really just a matter of learning what all the parts are and do, and where they go in sequence. It is all a dance, or a song that you play and play along with. Computers *can* get kind of complex in the watercooling and overclocking, but by all that is holy do you not find how intricately planned obsolescence is patterned into everything now (like a fake version of the real rule of scale-invariant fractal repetition), stamped out like shopping malls and prisons. 

But none of it is as complicated as you might think. It all takes a great deal of reading, research: intention. See, the thing about television is that it trains you to be that *consumer by definition* we were talking about earlier: you don't like it, you change channels, but you still remain in their channel. You are still just feeding from the trough. Same with skateboarding: it really is simple as shit, but you ain't going to learn shit 'less you actually get on the fucking board and remove the black obelisk from the perforated backside. Now do it frontside. 
Jump in the river. You know how to fucking swim, natural and shit. Your ancestors learned their trade and that memory flows through the veins in your hands, so make *and do* and make do. 

But if you do you, instead of letting the regularly scheduled program do you like prison shower floor posture, you can expect less else as a result. There are so many barriers put up, in terms of terminology and scapegoating and clever orchestrations, but honestly, most of it can be fixed with duct tape. 

There are really only a few *meta* rules to consider, the first being that *timing is everything*. The second is that everything is just a simple series of simple actions, which have to be followed in sequence. The last is that *everything requires respect*. 

Whether you are fixing an engine or a computer, the *analysis* side of the summation is always the same: you follow a process as you would follow a river, from its inception point, through every eddy, to the place where it rejoins with the ocean. Once you know all the parts, and what they are supposed to do, and what order they should go in, you just kind of follow the path, isolate shit in stages to see if that is the problem. 
 
Playing a song on guitar is no different to diagnosing a problem with a computer, only you can finish the song first time, every time. There are rules that we all must follow, after which we are free to freestyle, *become artists* within the boundaries of our craft. The most important thing to keep in mind is that *timing is everything*. But really, it is all quite simple: computers: earth yourself at all times, cars: jack that shit up properly, farming: prepare the earth properly, music: get in tune, fighting: pay attention, skating: pay attention to the eyes and rear shoulder. Really it is all just *pay attention* to what needs attention paid to it, like white blood cells. 

But it is *all* in the timing. Boxing first taught me that, but everything else I have learned over the years has only backed up such a proposition. Timing is *fucking everything*. From knowing when to dodge, strike, plant or harvest, snark that witty comment at the end of it: timing. It is all in the

2. It's not as though the only assassins available in KSA are MbS's bodyguards. Out of all the talent available to them, why would KSA choose those 15 people unless they deliberately wanted to connect the murder to MbS? 

3. The guy could've easily been killed in/abducted from a thousand other places instead of at the KSA embassy. Why would they choose that venue unless they deliberately wanted everyone to know about the murder and who did it. 

4. On the one hand they're really overt about how they did the murder and who did it, but on the other hand they refuse to hand over the body. If they were trying to make an example of the reporter by the brutality of the murder, a mutliated corpse would only emphasize their point. Why hide it?

5. Why allow the audio of the murder to be leaked on day one but not allow the video? Why publicize only a transcript of an audio recording that may or may not exist? (both 4 and 5 seem to strongly indicate that there was no murder and there was no body)

6. Why would Khashoggi not do his paperwork at the US based KSA embassy in advance before flying to Turkey for the wedding? 

7. How do you make a girlfriend in Turkey that's willing to marry you while you live mostly in the US? Dude's gotta have some serious charisma to have a super dedicated long distance girlfriend 15+ years younger than him. 

8. Also, wouldn't the marriage paperwork have to be done after getting married instead of before? 

9. If he was there for a divorce, couldn't that have been by mail and through a lawyer? If KSA law requires the divorcer to be present on government premises to process a divorce, where was the ex-wife? If she could do her paperwork by mail, why couldn't he?

132,Rothschild Zionists vs Vatican P2 and Asian Cabal- Predictive Programming Revealed In Pop Music Video,"  This is how the Illuminati bastards use Hollywood and the music industry to promote their devilish deeds. It's all smoke, mirrors and subliminal messages.

Kameran Faily, an insider of the global finance system, which has been known for thousands of years to employ thee most repugnant forms of human greed and despotism, has put forth an explanation of what he believes to be a notice of intent by the Rothschild Zionists to break free form the Illuminati treaty that binds them to the Vatican P2 lodge and the Asian cabal. 

We already know the entertainment industry in all forms is run by the Zionists. They have the ability to spread their messages by song and movie via pop culture. We know this predictive programming is real and is being practiced. The movies you watch today are tomorrows headlines. 

It's almost cliché any more to even mention the Rothschilds when discussing societal issues but the fact is, they are very near to the center of a monolithic conspiracy to rule the world.

The Rothschild family came into prominence in the 18th century and as they gained control of the Bank of London in 1815. They soon financially strapped the major commerce countries of the world. 

Nathan demanded silver be demonetized in England in 1816 making all debts payable only in gold. This sent the nation into a perpetual financial downward spiral. 

By 1821 the five Rothschild sons had a bank in Paris, London, Vienna, Frankfurt, and Naples thus forming the Rothschild banking empire.

This silver experiment that permanently crippled the English middleclass putting all the wealth onto the hands of the few at the top was finally cast upon America in 1873, then France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Greece in 1874. 

This act alone, removing parity between silver and gold, created colossal wealth for the Rothschild banking family while reducing the blue-collar sector to poverty. It is believed that by the 20th century they owned almost a third the worlds wealth. They created slaves of the populace through infiltration of government, despotic banking practices and subsequent federal taxation. 

Before Mayer, the Rothschild patriarch, died in 1812, he called his family together and discussed how they were to follow his rules to keep the wealth he had amassed in the family. They are listed as follows; 1) All key positions in the family business are only to be held by family members. 2) Only male members of the family are allowed to participate in the family business. It is important to note here that Mayer Amschel Rothschild also had five daughters, so today the spread of the Rothschild dynasty without the Rothschild name is far and wide. 3) **The family is to intermarry with it's first and second cousins to preserve the family fortune (according to the Jewish Encyclopedia 1905, of the fifty-eight Rothschild marriages to that date, exactly half, or twenty-nine, had been to first cousins)**. 4) No public inventory of his estate is to be published. 5) No legal action is to be taken with regard to the value of the inheritance. 6) The eldest son of the eldest son is to become the head of the family (this condition could only be overturned when the majority of the family agreed otherwise).

This is some serious greed. The Rothschild family has been so interbred that there is no doubt much of those who exist today are laden with depraved psychological issues. Every time I hear about this family in the news I automatically start hearing a banjo playing in the background as I remember the movie Deliverance. 

It is proven that bloodline incest is more important to them than anything else with the sole responsibility to the family fortune. They don't care about the mental well being of their own family, only the money and power it brings. 

The offspring since and those of today have exercised this depraved business philosophy only to produce a world of sickness and war with the sole intent to subjugate the global population into the clutches of this ""elite"" incestuous bloodline and ultimately the one world order which they intend to control. 

One way to prove this is to look at what the the Zionists are doing to the Palestinians in Gaza. Rothschild stole the land of Palestine and turned it into their own terrorist state of Israel in 1948. Hell, when you own 1/3 of the worlds wealth and are mentally deranged through 200 years of inbreeding, what else would you do?

Now that you have a much deeper understanding of today's global financial circumstance, let us get back to the main attraction. 

Today Jacob is the head of the family, with Nathan (Nat) to follow in his footsteps. 

Now that we have established who the decision maker of the family trajectory is, lets think back at all the shit the last couple decades has produced in our global society with regards to finance, government and military.

The hand of Rothschild is in all of this. Their fingerprints are all over this stuff. Jacob Rothschild is the decision maker. This guy is so inbred that he can not think straight. He is a maniacal sociopath if not a full on psychopath. No wonder these people worship Satan. They haven't a clue the difference between right and wrong. 

So now Jacob is upset with P2 and the Asian cabal because they are siding with Russia, and, they threw one of the Rothschild bankers out of a high-rise office building window to her death. 

Poor old inbred Jacob (banjo starts playing) had no better way to retaliate than to force Taylor Swift to sing a song designed by them and performed it in a music video that would detail his discontent and how he was planning to get even. 

Poor, poor inbred Jacob. All the money in the world could not have come up with a better idea. It's like they say, all the inbreeding destroys the creative faculty of the right-side brain. These people have no creativity. 

So here we are. 

This is some crazy shit but [take a look at it](http://projectcamelotportal.com/wp-content/uploads/End_Of_Illuminati_Treaty_Notice.pdf). Kameran does a great job here putting it all together. This is dated to a Taylor Swift music video released May 2015 called Bad Blood.

The question is, is it real? Is this really going on? Are the Rothschilds putting an end to their Illuminati partnership? What will be the outcome? Will the world be cast into disaster as these controlling entities battle it out? Did it kick-start what is happening now with the deepstate becoming mainstream?

Remember, all wars since Napoleon have been fomented by these inbred monsters and the current global situation seems to be getting worse everyday. 

As one cabal goes down, there is no doubt it will take as much life as it can with it. To hell in a hand basket. The result is, the cabal left standing inherits the power of the loser. More control is further concentrated into the hands of the fewer. 

All I have written here is what I know to be true historically speaking, and how I believe to be our global situation. I do believe there is truth to this that KF has presented. I do believe there is a major power struggle going on and that it will ultimately affect each and every one of us in the global community. Some sooner than others. We happen to be more insulated, so to speak, residing here in the British territory- the US Inc. However our time is eminent as we struggle more and more everyday to grasp the reality of our situation. 

In the words of Thomas Jefferson- *That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.*

They do not count the emissions and they want to double the trees burned by 2030. 8% of their diesel fuel is palm oil.

They import trees from all over the world, and call it green energy.

BECCS is code for turning rainforests into palm plantations and calling it reforestation.

155,Happy Birthday To The Gun Control Act of 1968- False Flag Induced- Government Conspiracy Guaranteed,"Today marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the [Gun Control Act of 1968](https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/gun-control-act). The GCA is the main federal law that governs interstate commerce of firearms in the United States. This law gave the federal government the power to control the movement of firearms around the country.

&amp;#x200B;

The assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King caused federal policymakers to rethink gun policy. In the JFK case, considerable uproar was made about how his alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was able to acquire his firearm via [mail-order ](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-guns-4832d1f2-a97b-11e5-b596-113f59ee069a-20151226-story.html)purchase. Even though President Lyndon B Johnson was not able get licensing and gun registration on the table, he succeeded in signing the GCA into law. The Gun Control Act imposes stricter licensing and regulation on the firearms industry, establishes new categories of firearms offenses, and prohibits the sale of firearms and ammunition to felons and certain other prohibited persons. It also imposes the first Federal jurisdiction over ""destructive devices,"" including bombs, mines, grenades and other similar devices. Congress reorganizes ATU into the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division (ATTD) and delegates to them the enforcement of the Gun Control Act. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the kicker, we know the patsies in each killing were not ultimately responsible for these hits. They were government conspired and funded assassinations. 

&amp;#x200B;

LBJ-  ""If guns are to be kept out of the hands of the criminal, out of the hands of the insane, and out of the hands of the irresponsible, then we must have licensing,"" 

&amp;#x200B;

These false flags, not unlike Vegas, Sandy Hook, etc. were used against the people to give the federal government more control over our gun rights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, registration for a medical marijuana card for medicinal purposes, the applicant waives his/her right to own a firearm. 

&amp;#x200B;

By patient gradualism the federal Marxist US Inc British territorial government that has taken place of our Constitutional Republic is out to get our guns, our voice and eventually us.

174,Naivety of the Intelecual Elite.,"Those of us that wander these halls are the most naive of humans. Those with other hobbies, hunting, sports, makeup are able to recognize in themselves that their hobby is esoteric to the uninitiated masses. We here fail to see like all other subgroups that the other, the masses, are incapable of seeing as we see. Those of us able to think about concepts rather than events or people have attained a level of intellectual self-actualization that the rest of the population is either unwilling or incapable of achieving. As we know slavery is a choice. Slavery is self imposed.

I have always been a good mediator in public disputes. I have an ability to see what is good for all parties in a group. Most people can only see what they can gain from a given situation. When a debate over a course of action occurs two parties can very rarely reconcile their differences in the form of compromise. I am a Pisces and I am able to see the compromise on the competing cloud of desires. We all must learn to wear this mask. 

We must realize the fact that the masses will never see the world through our lens. Their lives are lies. Distractions wrought with flashing images of sports teams, musicians, and actors, a new amorphous Pantheon of gods and goddesses. We are not a society that has evolved past or abandoned myths. We are still wrought with myth in our culture. And the most prevalent being the myth imposed on the individual by the individual. The myth that others will someday see as they see. We live in a world of multiplicities not dichotomies or monads. We here must walk down from the mountain in our mask. The masses will only recognize us as a friend if we deceive them.

Sure every society will be set up a bit different that's just how anarchy works but the basic structure of absolute freedom and equality will be the same.

There will be something like a mayor or high King that will be chosen each year through a round robin of arm wrestling and competitive slam poetry among eight other tasks. Our leaders are chosen though deeds, not glorified popularity contests. We believe democracy is Stockholm syndrome. Leaders act for what is right.They do not need to ""vote"".

Under anarcho monarchism;

Usury is illegal.

Rent is illegal.

Exploitation is illegal. 

Land ownership requires active improvements upon the land. Unimproved land is in the commons. The commons are to be respected. To defile the commons is a serious offence.

Americans live under a tyranny for at least two hundred years, ever since Mayer Rothschild bought the British Empire and said the famous “Let me have the right to issue money and the politiciens can write whatever laws they want”. This being the case, the Government with its Agencies is nothing more than smoke and mirrors to bamboozle the people. The ultimate authority lies with the party that can issue money and this party in the U.S. is not the President of the U.S., it is the FED. President Wilson sold it to the gang of Rockeffeller, Morgan, Rothschild, Schiff in 1913. The children and grand children of this group run the U.S. and control the lives of all Americans. They decide what wars Americans should die for, if they sloud have a home or be homeless.

Ben Franklin forwarned us about this and Henry Ford also in his book the “Inernational Jew”. By that time the Jews had bought all the newspapers and the people were given a daily dose of brainwashing medicine so today with super consumerism and way out sex the brain of the American people has become jello.

One President who saw the scam was sent to a tourist trip in space. If the current President is ordained by God to kill the monster of FED remains to be seen. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that we live interesting times.

Please pay attention:

“I am not an anti-Semite; I like Arabs.”

Did you understand that? The overwhelming majority of Jews are NOT Semites – (peoples from the Middle East).

If you do not like Jews, or their policies, you might be anti-Jewish, or anti-imperialist, or just don’t like long noses (joke), but you most likely are NOT an anti -Semite.

Now! There are anti-Semites, they are mostly Jewish Zionists who steal Arabs’, specially Palestinians’ land, murder many Arabs, push their puppet USA to attack and butcher Arab Nations, and, importantly, Slander Arabs and their supporters in the Jewish/Zionist owned and controlled Media.

The misuse of Language (and writing and teaching of fake history), are a key tools of repression in the Zionist New World Order. A perusal of George Orwell’s 1984, will explain in detail how and why language is misused and history fictionalized.

Nazi is short for Nationalsozialismus, or in english, National Socialism.




What is the conspiracy here? Why is this relevant?


The Nazis were socialists. They were socialists who used racial purity instead of class purity to gain power. They fought against the Soviets because leftists always eat each other. 



There has been a modern revisionist lie in academia and the media to relabel the Nazis as right wing fascists. In reality they were progressive left wing socialists.


Hitler was a progressive vegan environmentalist who supported animal rights.

287,"Patriot Act Section 213 ""Sneak and Peek"" warrants used for terrorism cases .5% of the time in 2013","Submission statement: As most of us here are aware, the Patriot Act was passed in 2001 with terrorism as its casus belli, with privacy advocates warning that once passed, it would be used for all types of investigations, not just terrorism.  Turns out they were right.  As the following article makes clear, in over 11,000 Patriot Act Section 213 ""Sneak and Peek"" warrants issued in 2013, only 51, or .5%, of requests were used for terrorism. The remaining requests were overwhelmingly for narcotics cases.   The full article is here:

[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/peekaboo-i-see-you-government-uses-authority-meant-terrorism-other-uses](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/peekaboo-i-see-you-government-uses-authority-meant-terrorism-other-uses)

&amp;#x200B;

As many of us know, the Patriot Act was written in advance of 9/11, and was rushed into law in response to those attacks (with a little help from Anthrax letters to the holdout Democratic Senator's -see footnote below\* with full credit to History Commons for the information) with the argument that the broad powers allowed by the bill, which in many cases infringe on constitutional protections, were absolutely vital to protect American citizens from further attacks.  Privacy advocates, and really anyone who has any understanding of the behavior of government agencies and institutions, knew that once passed into laws, those powers would be used as everyday tools in the law enforcement tool belt.  Of course, this is exactly has happened, as the numbers make clear.   Section 213 sneak and peek warrants are almost never used for terrorism cases.  

If Trump wants to drain the swamp, he could start by repealing this and several other articles of the Patriot Act, which infringe on our rights enshrined in the Constitution. He is already at war with these agencies,so if the FBI , NSA, CIA, and all the other ""deep state"" agencies are so evil, why isn't he taking this power away from them?  The Republican majority congress could pass a bill and get it on the President's desk tomorrow if they wanted to, they need zero democrat support if they vote party line, and yet they haven't.  The only conclusion available is that they don't want to. ( The idea that they want to, but can't really strains credulity, but if anyone wants to offer a coherent reason why this might be the case, I would love to see it.)  The question remaining is: why don't they want to? If there really is a deep state in the manner that some of the administration's allies and supporters in the media argue, why wouldn't you immediately take away a power that can be used to collect information on opponents? This reluctance is especially surprising when we're talking about a tool that power can be used for the collection of blackmail material, just to name one obvious example.

&amp;#x200B;

Why doesn't he take action on this issue?  As far as I know, he has never even mentioned the Patriot Act, much less called for it's partial repeal.  

Another question, I'm not a Q follower- has Q ever called for repeal of the Patriot Act, or even a single provision of it?

289,Youtube is not changing comments. The recent Taofledermaus video is just a bug. Proof inside.,"Youtube is not changing comments. The recent Taofledermaus video is just a bug. Proof inside.

So recently in a chat I'm in someone posted the video about Youtube possibly changing comments. I looked at the video and instantly something seemed off and it appeared more like some kind of caching/extension/grammarly error rather than a deliberate attempt to change someone's comments. It wouldn't make sense for youtube to receive a request for a comment, post it, then change the comment while the browser still hasn't been refreshed. If they were trying to censor comments it would be much more effective to leave the user's comment as-is on the page and just change it for everyone else (similar to a shadowban). 

I then decided to do some experimenting and unfortunately I couldn't recreate the bug at all on my end no matter what kind of comment I posted. I then talked to a friend who was having the same issue and she told me how her comments would change. I then found out she was using the youtube app where it would auto translate video titles similar to if you were playing youtube through chrome or had a translator extension. I then took Tao's comment and put it through google translate like a few comments on his video suggested and I found if you type in his comment as-is and then translate it from russian to english you get the exact same result. Video proof here: https://streamable.com/7ibd1

I then had her recreate Tao's situation and her own situation by typing in exactly what he said and then posting it. Unfortunately she couldn't recreate it either. Now all her comments are working as intended. Album of her screenshots here (only thing I changed was censoring the name that popped up in the third image): https://imgur.com/a/kh3pKEt

Finally, to make sure everything is working, I took screenshots in a private browser to make sure all her comments were showing up unchanged. We tested this a couple times successfully but unfortunately her second comment isn't showing up on my screen because we think it's being approved (repeatedly commenting the same thing over and over probably is tipping off the spam filter). Here's the first comment anyways https://imgur.com/a/epLRaKf

(I'll check in a few hours if it comes up, our first test worked fine but I didn't take a screenshot)

Right now based on everything I've looked at, it just looks like the page was actively translating tao's and my friend's comments on the fly instead of just changing the video title. I tried going through my browser's console but I got lost almost instantly. 

If anyone can provide additional proof of youtube changing comments or proof that this is just a bug that would be HUGELY appreciated. I want to get on youtube if they're actually doing something wrong but from everything I've experimented with so far it just looks like a bug that was very easily missed.

293,"the internet is by design and the most powerful tool the shadow government (elite, rulers, owners) have ever created to establish world dominance","the internet is the most evil and destructive influence in the history of the world. it has allowed the shadow government to spread their custom, synthetic culture to every corner of the world. all around the world, every peoples and culture is being systematically dismantled and replaced with the shadow governments own. everyone is being homogenized into a one world culture and people. old ways are dying, peoples values are changing. kids dont care about traditional skills, survival skills, growing food, helping family, etc. they care about fashions, what americans are doing, bling, money, work, city life, etc. the shadow government and capitalism are directly linked and part of each other. capitalism is the true one world shadow government, and the most powerful capitalists are the ones behind this and all other global conspiracies. 

&amp;#x200B;

many people will say, ""but anon! the internet is extremely useful, beneficial, and powerful for the people to gain info and organize against the elite!"" my responses are many...

&amp;#x200B;

1. any benefit of the internet is rendered useless and inconsequential in the face of the massive destruction it has wreaked on countless communities worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. the benefits it provides are only beneficial because the elite have already destroyed something in the first place. for example, the internet is essential to relearn old survival skills to escape the capitalist slave matrix, but the elite destroyed them first. the Internet wasnt needed before the elite destroyed global culture and everything else. they created the problem, and then the solution, and now we;re all addicted to the solution and cant stop using it. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. i doubt any meaningful resistance will ever materialize due to the internet. even if it does, it will be smashed just like any other. ultimately, resistance is futile, especially organized resistance.

294,"Is it just me or are Reddit comments to getting more ""hyper"" left than usual?","Like, maybe I've lost my grip on the collective ""good"", or maybe this is crazy enough to make sense, but I feel like hyper PC (politically correct) comments are getting fervently upvoted and anything but total agreeance is downvoted to the nine hells...

Now yes, I totally get the hivemind analogies and I've gotten caught up in a few emotional responses or two on the internet in my time...but this shift is different. This seems sudden...almost deliberate, and it's crazy enough to work if it's true. I need to post this while it's bugging me so I can make a better post about it on the computer later..

What if instead of the Russian bots promoting apologist sentiments of conservative, agendas (net neutrality, various hashtags on Twitter, etc) and upvoting conservative comments that would otherwise get down voted by sensible people, they upvoted the hyper left type comments. Most prominently ""SJW"" type shit to cast a figuritive net if I may. Posts that didn't warrant discussion on sensitivity, or just are out of place in any normal human conversation. But they seem to find their way into more and more and more posts lately. I know for me personally, words do not hurt. Ideas and actions, both intentional or unintentional, yes, but the words themselves are just tools. Up until the last....idk, three months maybe? I thought we all had a level of thick skin you only get from regular Reddit use, but then people on the internet all of a sudden started getting offended by EVERYTHING it feels like....or at least that's what the bots lead me to think (if this theory has merit). ""Why would they upvote stuff like that? What is your point? Being concience of others is incredibly important. Is this some republican political motivated conspiracy shit?"" All absolutely sane questions you might ask this day in age. Is it an age thing? Should I stop writing this? am I so out of touch with the average r/all user that I should be offended as well, on every single post? 

I wonder if I'll be motivated to rewrite this or maybe someone else can more eloquently state what I'm getting at, but that would definitely be a way to divide the left to me: upvote hyper ""PC"" statements, giving the optics of an extreme left mass appeal when really, and I hope I'm not alone on this one, but we aren't looking for something to be offended by ALL the time.

So then I catch myself going ""ugh....that was really not necessary to point out in the comments of a porn video, jackass"". Like literally, there's a vid where some chick does a cartwheel into an unsuspecting man's arms, he gets a face full of crotch and hastily tries to remove himself from the situation -- in the context of the GIF. One of the highest total voted comments was a full chain of double standard sexual harassment discussion. It was pointed out that in the source video, the dude ends up banging the chick because it's a freaking porno, but the votes still show no remorse for turning a porn situation into an act of social injustice. So that's what got me thinking....really drive home the ""SJW"" angle and it'll turn off a lot of left moderates that don't want to be mad all the time, which up until three months ago I thought was most people.

Or I'm not as progressive as I thought and I'm not in Reddit's majority anymore...which makes me sad, I really felt like I had my finger on the pulse of the world at one time. But I get annoyed reading Reddit now. Get deep enough in any comment chain and someone's offended by something and it's got 300 upvotes and the guy going ""yeesh, it was a joke"" is at -7.

We see a lot of mistruth around us, we stop think for minute about it  and then we get back to where we were left. Maybe it is just me, maybe I have too much time to think and maybe I am wasting this time doing it. That curiosity seems to slowly fade away, the more time I put into everything.

Some people say that money is fake, it is made out ot thin air and we are living in a modern day slavery. After my research into this thing, thinking about it logically, it looks like that money is fake, it is an idea. There can be as much debt(money) as we can borrow. But if it is fake, why humanity accept this? If money is debt and debt is money, why majority of people are still working for it. Every single day, every hour, every second for their entire lives. We pass this lifestyle to our children. If is it so bad why we did not have another crisis in 2012, 2015, 2017. Today it is 2018 october, debt is saturated the bubble should have popped long time ago, but it did not, economy is still fine. But why? Life is short, but 7kkk people literally accept it as a norm, only minor few of them questions it. I am starting to think that I am crazy and everything is just fine.

If they want war machine with Iran, Iraq and other countries they could achieve it easily with other ways. How they would pull, manage and control such a big lie. Again, majority of planet earth accept it as terrosim act, minority as an inside job. I do now know which one is the truth, again,  I am starting to think that I am crazy questioning this.

Some say that religion is fake. Then I think about it, it is logical. Some people created it for mass control. It worked well like a central govenment for a long long time. People want to believe in something, they need a leader to lead them. But then again, I have questions. Where we came from? Who created us? Who made this reality? Why some people accept religion and some do not. I do not know.

Some say that Hilter was a good leader. German soldiers killed my grand grand father and left it to rot on a same farm field which he worked so had for his entrie life. Soviets took everything from my family, put a lot of people in death camps, my mother was born in Syberia. Stalin industrialized the nation and at the same time starved part of that nation to death. Hilter created economic miracle and paradise in Germany. Even a peasant could afford a new car and drive it though newly built road. How can something come from nothing? Looks like it does. Austria met him with flowers, polish peasants met him with bullets in their heads. People used to say, then germans came they gave children a candy, then soviets came they left a pile of shit on peoples tables. One is labeled as a victor and a hero of world war, other as a satan and devil. One starved to death millions of ukrainians, other killed millions of jewish people. Again, am I crazy? What is the truth?

&amp;#x200B;

Some people say that Earth is flat. This is ridicilous, is it? Then I think about, mathematics, physics, science seems to prove that it is a globe and that we are a part of solar system. You can go to google Earth and check it yes? I think, and want to think that Earth is a globe. On the other side, why they do not give me a 360 live realtime view (not some combined CGIs from various distances) of the globe with zoomin zoomout so I could go outside stand with my smartphone and see myself live from the space? Why you cannot go to Antarctica without governments approval? How have they managed to make a connection from Moon to Earth then? If now I can go to deep woods not that far from my home and I will lose all of my cellphone connection signal. Why would they plan missions to Mars if they have not reached the Moon? Why waste so much money on rocket science and space programmes? How would they pull this big of lie on the whole earth then there is so much people, scientists, great minds working in that industry. Why would majority of 7kkk accept that it is a globe and minor few question and think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Some people think we are living in a simulation. Computer game has a set of rules. Life game has a set of rules. You can define some of those rules with math and physics. Rockstar created GTA V, someone created this game of life we live in. Someone wrote a code for bitcoin, noone fully broke it yet. Someone wrote a code for reality noone fully broke it yet. I feel like I am real person and environment around me is real, but is it? Who created this reality?

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion. It looks like that the best thing to do in this world is not to think at all. Probably the next best thing you can do is to create and manage your own human farm. Feed all the debt slaves and yourself with blue pills and everyone will be very happy and productive.

These beings for their own reasons are infecting people with parasites or monitoring insects, such as spiders that will go in your ear for them or parasites that will move throughout your skin leaving red marks where they're growing or cigarette burn looking scars as evidence.

 Your food as everyone knows has parasites but if you are a target for the shadow people and they know this food being prepared by a fast food worker or whoever will be eaten by you, they will infect it with their changing parasites

The parasites are to change us into a large nest of parasites. Anyone can see this if they so much as look at a person who is mostly ruined by this process

The shadow people will come in, and i believe they use sleep paralysis as a way in to introducing the parasites without a fight. I've heard that people who have sleep paralysis can see shadow people during the moments they are frozen

Even though they can grab time and just take out the moment when you caught them in your room or You, if you cause too much trouble for them and cause it/ you to not exist and never have existed

The reason I'm sharing this now is that my significant other is being targeted by the shadow people now because of my negligence, They put on clothes I set aside for myself I believe the shadow people set parasites in there and now They are truly infected

So quality of merchandize get downgraded every year, price soars, as the global corporations migrate to poorer countries, and oligarchs keep inflicting wars in unfortunate countries then the people in it flee to us, but we're already having difficult life to accept other unfortunate people.

349,Would you rather experience infinite pleasure or pain?,"Many Christians have this idea that if you believe in Christ you go to heaven and get this infinite pleasure and I'm not making a claim if that is true or not. Rather I am asking is that really what you want? Where am I going with this? Well lets start off with an example. Let's assume the most pleasurable experience one can have in a human body is an orgasm. Now an orgasm is a brief experience of a few seconds. Now imagine you had a year long orgasm? Would it still be pleasurable? Now make it last forever and ever and ever. All of the sudden it doesn't seem so pleasurable any more.

You can make the same argument for infinite pain as well. 

Why does this matter? Well what people who claim to desire heaven and act out there entire life through this fear of hell more than anything fail to realize it is not the highs that make things high, it's the contrast between high and low.

Ultimately you need pain or else the pleasure would lose all meaning. This universe is based upon contrast and it is this contrast that is ultimately the greatest illusion of them all.

Be thankful for this illusion and understand that living for ultimate pleasure will ultimately give you a hangover and living out of fear of ultimate pain will only make you feel guilty for being alive as to live is be imperfect and that's okay.",conspiracy,1540304528,skindoe,40,1,True,2018-10-23

From the article:

""When Frisk moved into a shared house earlier this year, he organized a chipping party for his new housemates. Now they can access the 16th century building they share in Stockholm's Old Town by tapping their hands on a digital reader by the door.""

My favorite part:

""I see no problem for [it] becoming mainstream. I think it's something that can seriously make people's lives better,"" Varszegi says.

""Osterlund believes there are two key reasons microchips have taken off in Sweden. First, the country has a long history of embracing new technologies before many others and is quickly moving toward becoming a cashless society.""

Not a big fan of the RFID chip. I believe it will give way too much power and control to corporations and government entities that are already proving on a daily basis that they cannot be trusted.

It's disturbing that we read about China's social credit score being able to affect a citizen's ability to access travel modes...while the writer of this article seems to be completely unaware of this controversial practice when writing this paragraph:

""They also can be used to store emergency contact details, social media profiles or e-tickets for events and rail journeys within Sweden.""

I guess I'm just an anomaly compared to the general public when it comes to reading too much into what appear to me to be obvious inherent dangers associated with RFID chips.

* Degenerate Education (Teaching kids how to worship LGBT Minorities. These people are suffering and the Patronizing by the elite just makes more kids fall into their trap and suffer. Universities no longer create elites but like-minded zombies)
* Corrupt Military (US Military has became what amounts to a civilian killing force instead of an army while Russia and China has giant armies)
* Trying to befriend Russia, China and North Korea while making the worst mistakes possible (The US innocently believes NK will abandon all of their nukes while likely they are just being coaxed into being off guard)
* Poverty while having the mask that it is rich (Living Standards in the US or UK goes downhill compared to those of Hong Kong or Singapore, with beggars all over the streets of Manhattan or London and Shanty Towns in various areas. Infrastructure goes to hell while there are millions of money for war)
* Endless wars for Israel (Syria and Iran fiascos. It's pretty clear they cannot even go into Iran or even secure territory in Syria and are just shaming themselves)
* Intelligence infiltration (CIA, FBI agents are all over the US and MI6 is all over the UK. You do not know what these people are working for; They are likely working for China or Russia.)
* Illegal Immigration going overboard (As a plan for ""Globalization"" North Africans and Pakistanis are imported all over the world. And strangely, only menacing, burly North African and Pakistani man are imported. Sounds like they are used to destroy, not enrich. They will all be in riot gear purging civilians when the day comes)

373,"In a system that allows propaganda, democracy becomes Stockholm syndrome.","We are led to believe though state indoctrination that we have a say in how the state functions. This is false. We are led by the Fabian Wolf. We are given a dialectic, two choices chosen by the same hand. Left and right, same body. Representative Democracy such as the one in the United States are instated to appease people into thinking they have a decision making power through discourse and democratic process. This is a facade used by all authoritarian beurocracies thoroughout history. We are the courtiers called to Versallies by Lois. Not so that we may govern more effectively. So that we can be controlled. 

Voting for a leader is weak. It only shows that the person with the slimiest tongue can rise to the top. It ensures no true merit. A leader must not be chosen by the people. A leader must be chosen by their deeds. The only divine force that can be seen and easily explained in the material realm is that of victory. The concept of victory houses within it a Calvinist predetermination that echoes of primitivism and superstition. But is that truly the case? I would argue that victory in all forms is in fact divine. (Not to be mistaken with divinely influenced.) A person who is a victor in a competition, for instance arm wrestling, is the winner. In such a situation there is either a winner or a loser. The winner wins. This bestows them with the grace of the goddess Nike. From earliest times contest has determined kingship. We must return to what has always worked. ""Modern"" methods of selecting sovereigns have allowed money to seep into politics. This is the great fault of our time. What system elevates money from how a leader is chosen?

Victory.

In Frazier's mandatory reading, The Golden Bough, he describes the legend of the, Rex Nemorensis, or King of the Wood. This person was the high priest of Diana; from Wikipedia, which actually has a phenomenal small segment on this

""The priesthood of Diana at Nemi was held by a person who obtained that honour by slaying the prior incumbent in a trial by combat, and who could remain at the post only so long as he successfully defended his position against all challengers. However, a successful candidate had first to test his mettle by plucking a golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove.

The human sacrifice conducted at Nemi was thought to be highly unusual by the ancients. Suetonius mentions it as an example of the moral failings of Caligula. Strabo calls it Scythian, implying that he found it barbaric. The violent character of this singular institution could barely be justified by reference to its great antiquity and mythological sanctity. The ancient sources also appear to concur that an escaped slave who seeks refuge in this uneasy office is likely to be a desperate man.""

""Those trees in whose dim shadow

The ghastly priest doth reign

The priest who slew the slayer,

And shall himself be slain""

In this legend any person may rise to the top of that particular priesthood through deed alone, plucking the bough, and slaying the sitting King. 

We must transcend our slavery. Anarcho monarchist principals can produce a state in which any individual is equal, even to the king. Every individual has the opportunity to become king. Through the yearly round robin of arm wrestling and competitive slam poetry. We must free ourselves from the Stockholm syndrome of democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

AWS (Amazon Web Services) has a 10 year contract with the CIA, this contract, worth over 600 Million USD effectively means the vast majority of CIA compute power is owned by Amazon. The recent introduction of Amazons personal assistant, Alexa is an obvious shot at their own data miner, a security analysis of the Amazon Echo has shown that it phones home almost 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

AWS Rekognition API is a highly accurate facial recognition API, it has the ability to process thousands of images per second, as it is based on Machine Learning, it becomes more and more accurate constantly, Amazon has recently began the sale of the software to Law Enforcement as well as the U.S intelligence community.

&amp;#x200B;

The acquisition of the Washington Post was a large powerplay by Bezos, since it's acquisition it has become a former shell of the once great Washington Post, the same institution which revealed the Watergate Scandal now profits from tabloids and panders to ultra left wing liberals, the majority of their articles solely slander trump. My belief is that the WaPo solely exists to spread misinformation and stoke the fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

The NDAA of 2013 (signed into effect shortly after the acquisition of the WaPo) loosened restrictions on the use of propaganda on the US public, 2013 also marked the year Cambridge Analytica was started. It has been revealed the WaPo was in cahoots with facebook, a blacklist which was supported by the WaPo was put into effect on facebook, over 800 accounts were purged.

&amp;#x200B;

Bezo's has declined to comment on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the reasoning for this is pretty clear to see.

Now, memes are not just silly pictures. The term “meme”, like I’m sure many of you already know, was actually coined by Richard Dawkins in the late 1970s. Meme was originally meant to mean a “unit of culture” the same way a gene is a “unit of DNA”.

The definition of meme is: an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.

The definition of memetics: the study of memes, tries to describe how an idea can propagate successfully.

Now what I find interesting is that this NPC meme spread like wild fire, and for an idea to literally “go viral” and spread like a virus.. well there has to be some truth to it. The collective has to resonate with it. So what does this mean, that a large chunk of humanity relates to the idea that there are empty vessels walking around in society? I think so. And if memes are “units of culture” well I don’t think this idea is new. I think this is something we’ve always believed. The Wojak meme may just be a “post-modern” take on this ancient archetype.

This archetype or meme has been expressed in countless different forms. Movies like The Terminator, The Matrix and They Live, and American Psycho all do a good job of telling the story. Ancient religions believed this idea too. Gnostics taught that there were some people who had no spirit and were used as “organic portals” for demonic forces. Judaism expresses this idea in the form of golems. I believe even Christianity references this idea when it talks about “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction” in Romans 9:20-23:

“But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?

What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—“

Are these “pots” made by God for “common use” really these empty people we’ve been talking about? Were they created with the purpose of being destroyed so God could demonstrate his power to his children, or “special pottery”?

Let’s say we ARE living in a simulation run by some alien Artificial Intelligence. Could we then make the comparison that alien parasites apart of some hive mind are the same as NPCs controlled by a computer? The simulation theory in general is somewhat archetypal or a “meme”. The Gnostics believed we lived in a fake reality controlled by a corrupt Demiurge. Sound similar?

I’m not here to say the left are a bunch of soulless alien parasites. I just wanted to take a deeper look at the idea because this subject really fascinated me for some reason. Anyways, if you got this far, thanks for reading. Maybe I’ll keep adding as I research some more.",conspiracy,1540330873,nickhintonn333,71,1,True,2018-10-23

469,"About the future of the conspiracy community, reddit, the new battleground Saidit.net and information warfare.","Hi guys. So I've been thinking a lot about recent events, a lot of people are frustrated with the shilling and there have been a lot of downs from our side because of the censorship going on at reddit. There are dark powers that don't want the corruption we talk about here to reach others so we are constantly under attack...
Since a lot of mods that are loyal to the conspiracy community have exposed the brigading, the constant attacks and the stalking against them to the admins and there has been 
almost no response, It's safe to say that there is a lot of corruption going on in reddit itself. I'm not saying all the reddit staff is involved but considering some mods get death threats often, well we have reasons to be paranoid.

User /u/magnora7 created a new website called [Saidit.](https://saidit.net/) I was hoping you guys would join us over there in order to have a better control of the attacks going on against us, but It's also to weaken their monopoly of
information. Basically I'm not telling you guys to quit reddit either, I think we still gotta keep up the fight over here. As I already said, the people in power don't like the fact that we expose the corruption going on in nearly all governments and 
as much as I think the quality of reddit itself has gone down, this place still reaches a lot of people. So I think It's important we take the responsability to continue posting about the political conspiracies. No I'm not trying to turn this into a 
fight of political conspiracies vs non political vs alternative stories, those of you who follow me know that I post about all that kind of shit. I'm just explaining the importance of exposing the corruption of politics. If we can weaken their monopoly of information we will be able to get a whole bunch of people not only on our side, but also against the true criminals behind the conspiracies.

So, we gotta constantly keep up the fight over here, organize ourselves at Saidit at the same time, while using all our resources to convince regular users to leave reddit by exposing them to the corruption going on and make them go over there too. So I'll need all the help you can give me to make regular users see the truth. All political subs, no not just here but even outside reddit itself have huge amounts of censorship and exaggerations of political correctness going on and we are probably the biggest community out there that knows about the secrets the people in power keep hiding from everyone, so we better take offensive actions don't you agree?

I also call the guys of TMoR and shills in general that attack this sub to surrender. I don't know what caused you to go down this path, be it apathy or a need of money or whatever, but for all the reasons I talked about before, you gotta admit there is a meaning in what we do if the information we talk about here reaches others and the constant attacks and demonization against the conspiracy community make that difficult. I admit we have our flaws but nobody is perfect. You can't use the excuse that what we do here doesn't matter anymore... so If you can tell us why you do it, who do you work for and if you can expose them in any way, I'm sure we would all appreciate it!

I'm sure you have all noticed it, but we are in the middle of an information warfare.

**EDIT**

The guys of TMoR have created accounts over there with names of the users in this place. If you see someone else using your username, please let Magnora know.

472,Why is your religion the right way to go?,"  

Before I start my questions, I just want to point out that I’m not a person against religion, I myself come from a religious family but I still have questions regarding what’s fair and equitable so keep that in mind. Keep in mind that I don’t want to offend or hurt anyone’s feelings through my questions So, let’s start

Depending on what religion you believe in you believe that it’s the right religion and the faith you have chosen is the right one. When accepting the faith, you have chosen you start to neglect the other ones. For an example if you’re Christian you wont like Muslims nor Jews and vice versa. But the thing is from what I have noticed is that depending on where you are born you are most likely and up like the rest of the people in that region/country. How is that free will? There sure is people who really find their own path to religion but for the majority, you’re born into a family who already had a religion to begin with and from a young age you as a person accept that religion because of the social norm with the family. Surely you don’t want to be the one that’s going to be neglected or hated within the family or community, so you follow the norm. 

Another example that I think of is who gets in to heaven and who isn’t. Just because you think your religion is the way to heaven, then why is it wrong for the other people who is following another religion? They might as well think that their way is the way to heaven. But let’s say that your religion is the way to go, but you’re born in to that religion depending on which country you’re born in. My question is what gives you the right to be directly affected by “the right religion” and you getting the chance from start to be part of the “true religion” and get your chance over someone else? Is the other person doing anything wrong? Well maybe in your eyes he’s believing in a religion that’s wrong but how should this person know this?

 As I explained earlier about depending on where you’re born you will adapt to the religion that is active in that region. What if the person if born in Afghanistan or Ghana or some other underdeveloped country. What gives you the right over that person? That person might not have the chance to acquire the knowledge that you posses and yet he is to be punished? Another question that I have. What happens to people who are born in a underdeveloped country with extreme poverty and the only way to get some food to the table is to steal some food. Why is this person act seen as a sin in the eyes of god? The person didn’t choose to be born in extreme poverty, nor to live in that place but still his action is still seen as a sin. How is it justice for a person to be born in the west and live a good life while there are children which are born in poverty and might not get the chance to reach 10 years of age, how is that justice?",conspiracy,1540335424,darklyguy,19,1,True,2018-10-23

1,"Benjamin Fulford Update 9/17/2018: ""MI6 Says Cabal Rule Could Collapse Within Three Months"""," 

There is a very real chance that Khazarian cabal rule will collapse over the next three months, and alternative power structures need to be made ready in time for that, according to British MI6 intelligence sources.  The trigger is expected to be arrests of senior cabalists in the U.S. starting in October, the sources say.  


Pentagon sources, for their part, said, “The Cabal has been deaf and blind for over two weeks, so big things should happen after Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation.”  


“Kavanaugh is poised to be confirmed after Yom Kippur on September 20 and on the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump may send texts to all cellphones to reach even more people than Twitter.”  Furthermore, the sources say FEMA will also test the emergency broadcast system on all televisions, so this, when combined with wireless text alerts, “will allow Trump to spread real news in real time and drop truth bombs.”  


The exact nature of what will be told to the American people through the emergency broadcast system is not yet clear.  However, last week representatives of the Swiss banking gnomes in Zurich, the Russian FSB, MI6, the Japanese royal family, and an Asian secret society all contacted the White Dragon Society (WDS) last week.  The fact that these sources, many of whom had ceased contact since the March 11, 2011 Fukushima nuclear and tsunami terrorist attack, suddenly popped out of the woodwork is a clear indication something huge is about to happen.  


CIA sources connected to the secret bases in Antarctica say the sudden surge of activity in the intelligence community was related the sudden closure last week of seven solar observatories.  In particular, the sources say:  


“The Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico has been ‘observing’ the sun since the Roswell incident.  They belong to a special …  


… off-the-grid group known as “The Watchers.”  There are several of these special observatories strategically placed around the planet.  


“They have files full of photos and video recordings of the Wingmaker ships coming through the sun, as well as the big ships coming through as part of the Galactic Federation’s Observe and Assist Humanity Mandate.  


“The Cabal Deep State is backed up against the wall.  They are grasping for feathers now.  They went in and grabbed everything out of fear and panic.  Gag orders have been issued.  


“We don’t know the final play yet.  This may turn against them and be used as the main act of the Disclosure Event.”  


The MI6 source said the observatories were shut down because they wanted to carry out a more orderly disclosure process in order not to cause panic or misunderstanding “among the surface population.”  


In any case, this may be related to a huge surge in UFO sightings around the planet recently.  Below are links to two examples reported in traditional media outlets:  


[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6136563/Four-UFOs-spotted-flying-presidents-Scottish-golf-course.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6136563/Four-UFOs-spotted-flying-presidents-Scottish-golf-course.html)

There has also been an unprecedented increase in tropical storm activity coming up that may be related to the unusual solar activity.  Last week the entire region of the tropics was covered in belt of storms, seven of which were big enough to be named.  


[https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-14/record-7-named-storms-are-swirling-across-globe-has-day-after-tomorrow-arrived](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-14/record-7-named-storms-are-swirling-across-globe-has-day-after-tomorrow-arrived)  


It is very interesting that, for the first time, the Swiss bankers in Zurich have decided to send an emissary to meet the WDS.  Vincenzo Mazzara and Leo Zagami of the P2 Freemason Lodge previously told this writer that they took orders from aliens based in Switzerland headed by an entity known as “the Black Sun.”  The Swiss representative acknowledged that their leadership had been taking orders from “the Black Sun” and that it communicated with them through “gamma rays.”  


At this point, readers who are accustomed to this report sticking to real-world issues are probably shaking their heads and wondering if somebody got to us.  The answer is that the forensic trail followed from primary sources like David Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the British royal family, Asian secret societies, etc. all pointed to some sort of control grid on this planet that is headquartered in Switzerland.  


It may well be that all of this woo-woo space stuff is just smoke and mirrors designed to hide a small cabal of old men (several sources say they are the “Elders of Zion”) from the prying eyes of the slave population they have been ruling over for so long.  


So, returning to strictly here-and-now earth issues, we can report that representatives from banking families in Zurich, MI6 (i.e., the British Royal Family), the Pentagon, the CIA, the Asian secret societies, and the Russian FSB all told the WDS that they support staging a massive, multi-trillion-dollar campaign to end poverty and stop environmental destruction.  


To make this possible, though, the cabal has to be completely removed from power.  So let us get back to the latest developments on that front.  


In the U.S., “The takedown of CBS chief Les Moonves may have spooked the Zionists, as his great-uncle was Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion,” Pentagon sources note.  Ben-Gurion has been fingered by newly declassified documents as the person who ordered the assassination of John Kennedy, so maybe now CBS will report this to the remaining audience who still believe in the corporate media.  


Furthermore, the sources continue, “The Trump executive order to sanction foreign election interference is targeting Israel more than Russia or the UK, because Israel interferes in U.S. elections.”  The Pentagon is upset with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for openly backing Mitt Romney in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.  The interference, they say, takes place via financier cut-outs like Haim Saban for the Democrats, and Sheldon Adelson for the GOP.  Furthermore, the sources say, “Hollywood/Wall Street/Silicon Valley 5th-column fundraising” has also been supporting “shills in Congress like Senators Tom Cotton, Chuck Schumer, and John McCain.”  


In addition, “The Trump trade war with China has the benefit of weakening Wall Street, since any bank or banker like Jamie Dimon who lobbies for China may be prosecuted for being an unregistered foreign agent, or worse,” the sources warn.  


The MI6 people, for their part, think their worst enemy is the European Union and the black nobility that own it.  They say German Chancellor Angela Merkel should be made to pay compensation to countries like Poland and Hungary for what “her bloodline” (Hitler et al.) did to them.  


It is very interesting in this context, then, to hear that the Russian FSB has been negotiating recently with the Knights of Malta who are, in many ways, the military arm of the P2 Freemason nexus that controls the EU.  We are assuming they are looking for protection against the impending Anglo-Saxon quest for justice.  


The other people the FSB has recently been doing work for are the Saudi royals.  The FSB source would not say exactly what they did recently for the Saudis, other than to note that it was “intense” and involved over 100 agents.  Since the Russian Orthodox Church has previously declared a holy war against radical Islam, the following article discussing plans to execute senior Wahab clerics may be related.  


[https://www.wsj.com/articles/push-to-execute-saudi-clerics-rattles-kingdoms-power-structure-1537097475](https://www.wsj.com/articles/push-to-execute-saudi-clerics-rattles-kingdoms-power-structure-1537097475)  


The other probably-related event has been that Russian Orthodox Church is having a schism with the Orthodox Church in Muslim-occupied Constantinople over its support of the Nazi-occupied regime in the Ukraine.  


[https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-religion-russia/russias-orthodox-church-freezes-ties-with-constantinople-over-ukraine-spat-idUKKCN1LU2IC](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-religion-russia/russias-orthodox-church-freezes-ties-with-constantinople-over-ukraine-spat-idUKKCN1LU2IC)

Remember, the Russians have been rivals to the Ottoman Turks and the Germans for centuries.  Also, the Nazis were responsible for creating the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islam as a way of undermining Anglo/French rule of the Middle East, according to MI6 and CIA sources.  


Something is also happening in Japan that could lead to regime change.  It turns out that Japan’s government was pumping carbon dioxide into the ground near the epicenter of the recent devastating earthquake in Hokkaido.  


[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-carbon-storage/japan-carbon-capture-site-shows-promise-for-industrial-use-idUSKBN1HQ0WZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-carbon-storage/japan-carbon-capture-site-shows-promise-for-industrial-use-idUSKBN1HQ0WZ)  


In other words, a slave government operating within the unscientific, Khazarian-mafia “carbon dioxide causes global warming” paradigm triggered an earthquake by injecting 150,000 tons of carbon into the ground.  This is all over the Japanese Internet, but of course the corporate media remains silent.  


Nonetheless, stupid moves like this are contributing to the emerging consensus among right-wing power brokers that the Bank of Japan needs to be nationalized.  This would remove a major source of funding for the Khazarian mafia.  This would also mean an automatic end to their slave regime in Japan.  


As the Khazarian mafia loses power around the world, it is urgent that the various rebel factions fighting for planetary liberation start making concrete plans for a smooth transition.  The WDS believes such a transition will require the announcement of a jubilee, followed by a massive campaign to fix up the planet.  Also, while the WDS supports a South African-style truth and reconciliation committee, it looks like many of the Khazarian mafia crimes have been so horrific that war crimes tribunals are inevitable.  Let us see what October brings.

I made a little tool that will help Twitter become a little bit more like Reddit. It's a website called [endorsed.club](https://endorsed.club) and it acts as a leaderboard for the best Twitter accounts within each Twitter community. This way people can see the various communities on Twitter and follow the appropriate accounts to become immersed in the community.

If you or someone you follow tweets about privacy related stuff simply @ them on Twitter and use the #EndrosedClub and #conspiracy for their account to be added to the privacy leaderboard [http://endorsed.club/?t=0&amp;q=conspiracy](http://endorsed.club/?t=0&amp;q=conspiracy) (no one has been endorsed yet!)

21,Can someone please explain how the US and Russia are enemies? We’ve been allies since WWII,"The “Cold War” is a giant crock of shit. It’s the original “war on terror”,  we call it a war, but the enemies are faceless and the conflict can go on forever, because there’s no winning against an ideology. It’s decades of propaganda 

The actual conflicts involved in the Cold War, like the war in Vietnam, were exclusively fought by either the United States military against a communist faction in a 3rd world country, or by communist and nationalist factions in 3rd world countries, with neither the USSR or the US getting directly involved. 

Please tell me, how are two countries selling weapons to either side of a conflict  enemies? Sounds like people working together to make money. When exactly have American and Russians soldiers actually fought and killed each other? As far as I know, never. 

America was involved in these conflicts like Korea and Vietnam so that the American military industrial complex could sell more weapons to the US military. That’s the only reason. The myth of “stopping the spread of communism” is such bullshit it’s not even accepted in whitewashed history books any more. 

As far as I know, Russia never got directly involved in any conflict during the Cold War. Maybe I’m wrong, I learned the history from the America point of view. But the AK-47 is a Russian gun, and the most widely sold and used gun in the world. The Russian military industrial complex was more than happy to sell these guns and plenty of other weapons to any communist faction who wanted to buy. 

Once again, all I see here is two countries making tons of money off of war. And using each other as the proverbial “boogie man” to keep its citizens in line. Working together to create a global climate of fear. What do people do when they’re afraid? They shut the fuck up, put their heads down, fall in line, and consume. The anti communist propaganda was especially brilliant because it caused people to start policing themselves. Better fall in line and act exactly like everyone else, or risk being called a commie and ostracized by your own community. 

The space race is the perfect example of this. People in America were fed up with the government wasting all their money on an arms race for the biggest nuclear arsenal. So what did the American government do? Find a way to repackage it into some noble quest for future technology and the exploration of space. Public opinion was once again swayed back to heavily supporting this “space race”, even though the rockets they were developing had obvious military application. The same rockets that America poured billions into developing that took men to space, were the same rockets that were capable of delivering a nuclear warhead across continents. And during the whole space race, the United States was secretly putting dozens of spy satellites into space, to create the first military version of google earth, and have ultimate intelligence and spying on a global scale. 

Once you realize that the governments of the US and the USSR have never been enemies, so much more becomes obvious. For instance, the biggest “debunking” of the moon landing conspiracy usually goes something like this: “Well America couldn’t possibly have faked the moon landing, because the Russians would have known and called them out on it.” The Russians were in on it. They knew it was faked, and the two governments worked together and agreed that America was to be the one to “make it” to the moon first. 

I mean, they had a fucking direct telephone line between the presidents office and the prime ministers office in Russia. You really think they were calling up and threatening each other? I think it’s far more likely the conversation went something like this: 

Ring ring 

Regan: “Oh hi mr. Gorbachov. How are you. What should I say today? Ok, tell them the USSR has threatened to move nuclear weapons into Cuba? Sounds good. And you tell your people, that America has its finger on the button, and we’re always ready for war. Good? Ok, talk to you later.”

“Get the press secretary in here, tell her the Russians just threatened to put nuclear missiles in Cuba. “ 

News goes out to the American public: Russia has threatened to put nukes in Cuba! Omg, panic! 

All manufactured, all propaganda, all a lie. 

Now of course I know about the Cuban missile crisis and other “close calls” where nuclear war almost happened. No, really bro, it seriously almost happened. 

Yeah, but it didn’t. And the narrative around these events was always controlled by the government and by the MSM. They can tell whatever story they want and the people will eat it up and canonize it as history. 

Now this stupid red scare shit is coming around again and I can’t believe how easily people are just eating it up. Omg, trump colluded with Russia! 

Of course he did. So did Hillary. Every single US administration since WWII has colluded with Russia. It’s only the brainwashed masses who think we are enemies. The reality is we’ve been closer to business partners for decades now. 

I would love to see any evidence of there being actual conflict between America and the USSR, that isn’t just a story coming out of the military of the government. If anyone can help me learn, I would love it. Because right now all I can see is two countries working together to keep their citizens in line, to get public support behind pouring billions into developing military tech, and to sell as many weapons as possible to whoever would buy them.

42,Is Q-Anon a pied piper IC psy op designed to pacify the MAGA movement? I present to you my theory.,"Hypothesis: QAnon is a government/spook psy op pied piper designed to pacify and distract boomers in the MAGA movement. Q encourages people to sit back and wait while ""the good guys"" take care of business. Q convinces dissidents that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.


My theory:

QAnon in my subjective opinion is too sophisticated to be a troll LARP. Qanon is a government psy op similar to cicada.


A cult has quickly formed around Q. An entire industry of pundits and news sites looking to monetize the cult has formed around Q. The MSM is writing about Q. All of these things point to me that Q is a government psy op.




My theory about what is going to happen moving forward:

The spooks running Q are running out of material, which is why they are now talking about ayylmaos and UFO disclosure (also predicted programming for project bluebeam in case they wind up pulling this out in the future.)




In the somewhat near future, Q is going to stop posting. With their pied piper gone, the cult of Q is going to fall in to depression and despair. Many in the cult will assume ""Q and the good guy patriots"" lost, and will begin committing suicide, or acts of violence against ""deep staters and radical lefties.""



*If Q was an actual dissident patriot operation fighting a coup against our shadow government, the MSM spook mockingbird media would not give it more publicity. They want the Q movement to grow bigger because they want to blame all the upcoming Q-cult suicides and false flags on Donald Trump.


Trump is having security remove Q signs from his rallies BECAUSE HE IS AWARE OF THE PSY OP.


#As for the ""Q proofs""-Q doesn't predict things. Q is a government psy op, and the government (via NSA and other ICs) are everywhere and know everything that is going to happen before it happens. They are the top intelligence service in the world for a reason. ""Q proofs"" are just confirmation bias and soft disclosure. ""Tippy top"" for example is just a phrase that Trump is recorded as saying on camera several times in the past-ICs would definitely be aware of Trump's speaking patterns so they could copy it if they ever needed to. Like if they needed to run psy ops on their population for example...



They banned QAnon discussion on reddit because they are well aware of the Streissand effect and they are well aware that this would help further legitimize the psy op in the eyes of the cult of Q. Do you really think ""these people are stupid""? That is exactly what our ICs want you to think about them. *Never underestimate your enemy, and do not act like you've won before the battle was over.* If Q was a legit patriot faction working on behalf of the American people, it would be well aware of these basics.


TL;DR-Q is a pied piper psy op ran by the deep state designed to honeypot boomers and dissidents and pacify MAGA. The eventual plan is for Q to stop posting, then the cult that has developed around Q will begin going crazy.
Q Anon mixes real information, soft disclosure, and rabbit hole bullshit. Q Anon plays on our confirmation biases and uses NLP to program and brainwash people who follow the posts.

46,Conspiracy culture vs activism. My opinions on the subject and hopefully a civil debate.,"What is the ""conspiracy culture""?

I believe it to be people that are like minded researchers who gather to discuss the understandings they have come to through research and info vetting. To discuss different views of things/events/agendas that result from looking at these things from different perspectives, though the perspectives created from certain uncover truths.

It seems to me that many want to merge the ""conspiracy culture"" with activism. I see that as a problem. Which perspective and view point should the activism be towards? Once you have locked in this perspective and view point then what happens when new truths or understandings have emerged? 

&gt; ""Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled."" - Michael Crichton

Conspiracy people still debate JFK, the moon landing exc.. Nothing is ever fully settled. 

I see activism as being locked in on something very specific. I don't see that as being consistent with conspiracy. Conspiracy is always evolving.  When I consider things I like to consider them through multiple perspectives to gain a fuller understanding.

You see this with the partisan posts and with the anti-this or anti-that posts. That is activism portraying it's self as conspiracy. 


Some cry ""they are making us look bad, these thoughts must be censored"". Really? We care what the normies think about us tin foil hat wearing UFO hunters? Since when?

I see the merging of conspiracy culture and activism as the scourge that is meant to limit our thoughts and discussion to approved thoughts only.

Well it all makes sense now. 

The Redditor created their account in order to share the information. Once the information was posted, it *quickly* gained over 37,000 votes and was guilded two times. It rapidly spread via various subreddits. 

Once the post had reached maximum attention and it was beginning to become ""just another T_D post"", the user deleted the post, then deleted their account either knowing this would create hysteria surrounding the research and their account deletion or advised certain subreddits of what was to happen so they could advertise the ""sudden deletion"" of the post and advertise the account was deleted too. 

The admins would then be used as a scape goat and the ""Is Reddit a Russian Propaganda tool?!"" would be implemented, citing The_Donald as their 'example' of Reddit allowing the alleged Russian propaganda the Redditor had found. 

All of this would *then* create more hysteria and put attempted pressure on Reddit to defend itself, claiming they are not in fact doing what is claimed and delete The_Donald as definitive proof or at the least, put a quarantine or the like. 

The OP of the post who started all of this drama seems to have had it directly out for The_Donald from day one and even left this in their departing message

&gt;I find propaganda and get a passive aggressive post about me? Fuck that noise too. 

&gt;Fuck The_Donald.

&gt;I'm out.

Their admittance of what they caused and that they actually deleted everything followed by a direct ""Fuck The_Donald"" (which had *nothing* to do with their comment) leads me to believe that, as I said before, this was all created and done to get The_Donald banned. 




This whole thing seems to have been purposely executed the way it is happening but now, nothing has been accomplished except showcase how divided, uniformed, misguided, unorganized and confused most of this website actually is.

75,Let's revisit Abu Ghraib.,"The events at Abu Ghraib received considerable media attention, many people seem to look past the obvious absurdaties of the whole situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

For one, few realize the few accused committed no actual crimes, unseen in almost all these photos are the military and CIA interrogators who were usually off camera, Graner and England in most of these images simply posed with the inmates. 

&amp;#x200B;

This revelation brings many unanswered questions, what were the motives in documenting this torture, military intelligence officers and CIA instructed MPs to document this torture, these were not souvenirs, not keepsakes, they were specifically instructed to take dozens of these photographs, why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why were no military interrogators, private contractors, or CIA employees ever accused or indited for the crimes they committed (they were directly accused of rape, murder in cold blood, and sadistic torture, it is obvious MPs were chosen as complete and utter scrapegoats.

&amp;#x200B;

My belief is that the events that occurred at Abu Ghraib were purely done for psychological purposes, the majority of the abuse that occurred was based off of the 1963 CIA document ""KUBARK counterintelligence interrogation""

&amp;#x200B;

It is stressed in the document that torture has the potential to be counter productive, basically, if you torture them, they'll torture our prisoners of war in retaliation.

93,"LIBOR and Euribor, economic terrorism?","The LIBOR and Euribor price fixing scandals represented unprecedented fraud, fraud committed by Tier 1 Investment banks, banks ""Too Big To Fail""

&amp;#x200B;

The LIBOR scandal was first exposed by the Wall Street Journal around 2008, this article suggested banks had underreported their borrowing costs in the interbank market for unsecured funds, by submitting quotes for LIBOR below estimates of such costs implied by CDS spreads.

&amp;#x200B;

Although several dozen banks committed acts of LIBOR price rigging, only 1-2 banks paid more than a couple hundred million dollars in fines and settlements, only rough estimates place the cost of this price fixing to investors, but it estimated to be around 6-7$ billion. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the time of this scandal, around 200 Trillion USD was tied to LIBOR, LIBOR is extremely crucial to global financial markets. 65% of over the counter USD denominated interest rate swaps are tied to LIBOR, and 97% of syndicated loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, LIBOR is planned to be phased out. Sadly, the banks have chose to manipulate Euribor rates as well, unfortunately, no estimate has been put on how much this would have cost investors, but as it also is tied to trillions and trillions of dollars of credit cards, student loans, and mortgages, the cost is likely in the billions.

&amp;#x200B;

To add further insult to injury, many of these banks were bailed out, during 2008, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and the Bank Of England purchased 2.5 trillion USD of debt from several banks.

&amp;#x200B;

The time traveler then went off on how Oprah Winfrey would also run for president and ultimately [lose to Michael](https://youtu.be/s3Ehmi4xHe4?t=6m36s).

122,Mods remove founder and fail-safe of r/conspiracy for 'inactivity',"u/illuminatedwax founded this sub 10 years ago and was removed by reddit admins last night, as per request of the other mods.

Would the mods care to explain what damage was being done by u/illuminatedwax, to warrant such a drastic move? What fueled you to campaign the site admins to remove him, considering his inactivity had zero effect on your ability to properly moderate this place?

And where has the stickied [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9hmhps/announcement_top_mod_uilluminatedwax_has_been/) gone, u/axolotl_peyotl? 

One would think you would leave news like this up for at least...one full day?

124,United States and Ancient Rome. “Amorica”. Hadrian’s Wall.,"[Amorica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armorica)

Hadrian (/ˈheɪdriən/; Latin: Publius Aelius Hadrianus Augustus; 24 January 76 – 10 July 138 AD) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138.

[Hadrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian)

[Hadrians’s Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall)



&gt; Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders, and the unification, under his overall leadership, of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia.




&gt; On his accession to the throne in 117, there was unrest and rebellion in Roman Britain and from the peoples of various conquered lands across the Empire, including Egypt, Judea, Libya and Mauritania. These troubles may have influenced Hadrian's plan to construct the wall as well as his construction of limites in other areas of the Empire, but to what extent is unknown. 

&gt; The limites of Rome were never expected to stop tribes from migrating or armies from invading, and while a frontier protected by a palisade or stone wall would help curb cattle-raiders and the incursions of other small groups,the economic viability of constructing and keeping guarded a wall 72 miles (116 km) long along a sparsely populated border to stop small-scale raiding is dubious.


&gt; The remains of Castle Nick, Milecastle 39, near Steel Rigg


[His cousin, Trajan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan)
Looks a little like Putin?


&gt; In terms of his later career, Hadrian's most significant family connection was to Trajan, his father's first cousin, who was also of senatorial stock, and had been born and raised in Italica. Hadrian and Trajan were both considered to be – in the words of Aurelius Victor – ""**aliens**"", people ""from the outside"" (advenae).

&gt;In Rome, Hadrian's former guardian and current Praetorian Prefect, Attianus, claimed to have uncovered a conspiracy involving four leading senators, who included Lusius Quietus.There was no public trial for the four – they were tried in absentia, hunted down and killed.Hadrian claimed that Attianus had acted on his own initiative, and rewarded him with senatorial status and consular rank; then pensioned him off, no later than 120.Hadrian assured the senate that henceforth their ancient right to prosecute and judge their own would be respected.

&gt;The reasons for these four executions remain obscure. Official recognition of Hadrian as legitimate heir may have come too late to dissuade other potential claimants.Hadrian's greatest rivals were Trajan's closest friends, the most experienced and senior members of the imperial council;any of them might have been a legitimate competitor for the imperial office (capaces imperii);and any of them might have supported Trajan's expansionist policies, which Hadrian intended to change.



&gt; The rulers commonly known as the ""Five Good Emperors"" were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.”

Reminds anyone of “five eyes”? Or is it five “i’s” as in 9. 5 good emperors?


Weird.

Hey! [I told reddit I have proof of Russian propaganda on The\_Donald](https://archive.is/o/qIDX7/https:/www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/9gl26q/the_donald_is_a_violent_extremist_group_being) and I'm here to deliver.

**Use judgment before you click any links.**

# Group 1 - Internet Research Agency / ""USA Really""

Recently, a very The\_Donald looking [website started showing up (geotus(dot)army)](https://archive.is/FXHuc) almost exclusively on The\_Donald. ""GEOTUS"" is a phrase T\_D uses frequently to refer to Trump being ""God Emperor of the United States"" because cult. After [my previous post](https://www.removeddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/9gl26q/the_donald_is_a_violent_extremist_group_being/), they have switched to using [another (similar) domain (geotus(dot)band)](https://reddit.com/domain/geotus%2Eband/top?t=all). The domain is [registered and hosted in America](https://whois.domaintools.com/geotus%2Earmy), so naturally this must be safe to click and upvote, right? After clicking, you might notice  **all**  the links [redirect to another website (usareally(dot)com)](https://reddit.com/domain/usareally%2Ecom/top?t=all). ""USA Really"" is [registered and hosted in Russia](https://whois.domaintools.com/usareally%2Ecom). So what gives? If you go directly to geotus(dot)army or geotus(dot)band you'll see it's a link shortener service hosted by rebrandly.co. There are plenty of reasonable uses for link shortener services, but mostly you'll find spam and sites evading bans. So why would USA Really need to use this service? If you look at [their about section](https://archive.is/vKL4A), they conveniently link to [their LinkedIn page](https://archive.is/o/qIDX7/https:/www.linkedin.com/company/usa-really). Wait, who's running this site? [Alexander Malkevich](https://www.yahoo.com/news/meet-man-behind-new-pro-trump-russian-website-u-s-2-102124858.html), you know, the guy that works for [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://archive.is/uBy3B), the Russian billionaire known as ""Putin's chef"" currently under indictment by  **Robert Mueller**  for running the Russian troll farm Internet Research Agency (IRA). So, that innocent-sounding ""American"" website is actually Russian state propaganda, but big deal, there's only a few links. That's because [their previous website](https://reddit.com/domain/brutalist%2Epress/top?t=all) was shut down and it has a _ton_ of links targeting The\_Donald. This is just the next iteration.

# Group 2 - DRN Media PLC

I found another group of Russian propaganda sites I feel is worth investigating. I have no proof they're _state-sponsored_, but what is clear is that  **they are propaganda**  and  **they are Russian**.

Reasons I think they're state-sponsored:

- Site executives/founders are Russian nationals and have worked for Russian state-controlled media outlets.
- Known Russian twitter and reddit accounts frequently share links from the sites real-time.
- Content follows Russian propaganda hashtag trends _consistently_.
- [Shell companies based in Cyprus](https://archive.is/o/qIDX7/https:/www.linkedin.com/company/the-duran) with shady PO box address in California are majority owner.

Reasons I'm not 100% sure:

- They haven't specifically said they're Russian state-sponsored propaganda.
- They run ads [and a store](https://archive.is/o/qIDX7/https:/drnshop.com/). Idk, just seems odd.
- They've been active for _years_.
- They're still looking for investors.

When I'm having a bite to eat, got time to surf around and do research. Over the years, when I'd look for conspiracy stuff, the bibliotecapleyades.net site kept coming up. So many sub pages on all kinds of topics. 

Sometimes I'll do a word combination search for something limited to that site and check those pages over the following days. Tonight did a search for smartphones and starting to go through that. Was reading this page, ""The reasons why we can't put down our smartphones"". Read this sentence, 

*""The most overarching of the dynamics, and the one that gives the others context, is what's known as the brain's reward system - the electro-chemically charged power grid that neurotransmitters surge through when our brains are doing what they're structured to do""*

Then I'm thinking, hmm.. the way the brain works is maybe like these really weak electric signals, I bet. It's like a really low voltage. Sort of like how you can power a light with, what is it, a lemon or potato or something. haha. Some kind of really low electricity going on in your brain.. and who knows if some type of electromagnetic field could affect it. We can't see any of these fields, and it's really low voltage.

Thought of this video bit I saw the other day. Was looking into electromagnetic field microphones. Never heard of those before. They'd go around to objects and you hear the very subtle fields that are emanating. When this guy went up to a smart phone, and was changing screens, the electromagnetic field noises were shocking. I'm there, wow.. this is a lot of racket coming out of this phone and it's like a bad buzzing noise.

""Testing out Elektrosluch Mini City""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhhuVbS6PmM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=25s

If your brain functions off a really low voltage of, what is it.. neurons firing signals with each other or something.. Maybe this electromagnetic field you hear emanating from the smartphone could somehow affect your brain. 

I wonder if these manufacturers could possibly have tested stuff out so they'd ramp up you getting addicted to it with some type of electromagnetic field. I don't know if it's possible but who knows. You can't see any of it. 

People really do zombie right out when they stare into their phones. Then when they're forced to shut it off, like at work, they can't handle it. They're like a crack junkie when they run out. Any spare moment, they have to stare into it again. Maybe it's like they're addicted to this electromagnetic field.

I doubt there's a ""conspiracy"" going on with some type of field that makes people hooked.. but who knows. Thought I'd post this. Somebody might have some ideas.",conspiracy,1537577010,TheWeatherIsNiceOut,13,6,True,2018-09-21

I've lurked on /pol/ for a while and I've seen LARPs come and go. In the beginning I believed that Q was just a LARP, but even at the beginning it was already one of the most complex and compelling I'd seen. I chose to believe it was a LARP for the same reason many claim they do now. Its vague, doesn't seem to really mean anything, missed predictions etc. EVEN THOUGH I believed it was a LARP, I considered it a good thing. It doesn't matter if Q was real or not, he was serving redpills left and right. He was waking people up. 

Anyways as time went on I started to believe Q more and more. (Not believing the MSM narrative that is the international satanic pedo ring run by clinton) but believing the fact that Q isn't a LARP. After seeing proof after proof and seeing how things are playing on the political stage lately; it really does seem to all line up.

The point of this post is not to prove Q though.

**Point is..**

138,The Black Mirror Conspiracy.,"The idea that black mirrors will steal you soul has been pushed by evil people for centuries. Black mirrors are more acurate than any other mirror and evil people HATE looking at themselves in them. They cannot stomach how ugly their persona is. They finally see what others see and it typically drives them to suicide. The Luciferian higher ups have for a long time tried to destroy the idea of black mirrors because they are so dangerous to their minions.

Stare at your face in a black mirror. If you don't have a black mirror you can use your mobile when the screen is off and black. Keep the mirror still and stare between your reflection's eyes. For most people, your eyes will go blurry and you will FEEL how out of sync your eyes are. One way to help correct them is to get each eye to focus on its own reflection, both at the same time.

Maybe 1 million years later they have developed even more intelligence. 10 million years later? They develop perfect camouflage. Given the right conditions it is possible that the offspring of these creatures would be super intelligent and have camouflage so perfected that they are undetectable.

156,"Worse than nothing, how ineffective vaccines enhance disease","In the current debate over whether or not to legislate the removal of individual vaccine exemptions, the quality of the [vaccines](http://www.focusforhealth.org/a-parents-guide-to-vaccines-environmental-toxins/) themselves gets little attention. According to the CDC, **mumps outbreaks are on the rise despite the fact that 94.6% of children in the U.S. have had two doses of MMR vaccine.** To combat the situation, the CDC is  considering adding a third dose of MMR to the recommended [vaccine schedule](http://www.focusforhealth.org/can-i-space-out-the-vaccine-schedule/).

In 2010, California experienced the largest pertussis epidemic since 1958. According to the CDC, the U.S. has experienced increased pertussis disease despite high levels of vaccine coverage. **Researchers studying the pertussis outbreaks determined vaccine effectiveness dropped to less than 9%** by four years, and that the quality of immunization waned so rapidly that little protection remained 2-3 years after vaccination.

[**Influenza vaccination**](http://www.focusforhealth.org/seasonal-flu-shot-and-safety-testing/) **has had no beneficial effect on flu mortality.** The CDC indicates vaccine effectiveness has oscillated between 10-60% from 2005-2017,  while systematic reviews show little to no benefit of inactivated influenza vaccines on flu morbidity.

It’s clear that some vaccines don’t work as well as advertised. And yet, instead of first making a vaccine with better effectiveness, the solution is to use the force of law to make everyone get more shots of the failing vaccine.

Even when significant vaccine failure rates for vaccines are  acknowledged, the legislative solution remains fully supported. Concerns over the need for more effective vaccines are dismissed by apologetics pointing out that the current vaccines are better than nothing.

The assumption is implicit: low immunity is better than no immunity.  So, until a better vaccine comes along, accept the current shot at whatever level of immunity it provides.

But the notion that any amount of antibodies is preferable to no antibodies at all, is dangerously wrong. **The same exact antibodies that prevent disease at higher concentrations, can enhance the disease at lower concentrations.**

Instead of preventing infection, the antibodies permit a more invasive spread of the virus into different cell types, enhancing the disease and making it worse than if the child had never been vaccinated.  This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, and it is a potential problem for vaccines that induce low levels of antibodies.

It’s not just a theoretical concern. It has happened. Vaccine-induced  disease enhancement occurred previously with a measles vaccine that produced low levels of immunity.

## From [Iankov et al. 2006](http://jvi.asm.org/content/80/17/8530.full):

&amp;#x200B;

* An unexpectedly severe form of measles (atypical measles) was observed in immunized persons in the mid-1960s;
* Three doses of measles vaccine induced a short-lasting humoral immune response, followed several months or years later by susceptibility to atypical measles;
* Antibodies recognizing measles virus can increase the efficiency of virus entry into cells of the monocytic lineage;
* Antibody-mediated enhancement of infection may also contribute to  cytokine alteration and modulation of the innate immune mechanisms  during measles;
* The results point to an additional pathogenic mechanism that may be  in play during measles virus infections and which may have particular  relevance to the pathogenesis of the atypical measles that is seen after  immunization.

The effect of vaccine-induced disease enhancement has been seen in clinical trials for a since abandoned HIV vaccine.

## From [Huisman et al. 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022319):

&amp;#x200B;

* Certain experimental vaccines have proved to be counterproductive:  they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather  than protecting them;
* For candidate HIV vaccines a number of phase III trials have been  conducted in seronegative volunteers at high risk for HIV infection;
* The outcome of these trials was far from encouraging, with very  limited induction of HIV neutralizing antibodies, and no evidence for  protection;
* In one clinical trial, a significant trend towards increased HIV-1 infection was observed;
* Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection remains a significant concern in the development of safe and effective vaccines;
* There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of  protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced  susceptibility on the other.

**The** [**HPV vaccine**](http://www.focusforhealth.org/a-closer-look-at-hpv-vaccine-effectiveness/) **exhibited the capacity to enhance HPV infections during clinical trials.** Women who tested positive for vaccine HPV serotypes by PCR analysis, and were then administered the vaccine, were more likely to  develop high-grade cervical lesions than the non-vaccinated control group. These observations have persisted beyond clinical trials, and  antibody-dependent enhancement has been raised as a possible  explanation.

## From [Manos 2009](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61821-3/fulltext):

&amp;#x200B;

* Vaccination of women with previous HPV 16 or 18 infection might actually increase their risk of high-grade cervical disease;
* This observation is strikingly consistent with reports on the quadrivalent HPV vaccine;
* Although each trial’s finding was attributed to imbalances in the  baseline characteristics of the vaccine and placebo groups, the  biological phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease  should be considered;
* Perhaps HPV testing should precede vaccination and be contraindicated for women and girls previously infected.

It’s been known for decades that non-neutralizing influenza  antibodies can augment the uptake of influenza A virus strains, but it  wasn’t until recently that the phenomenon of disease enhancement for  influenza vaccination was observationally proven.

In 2009, seasonal influenza vaccination increased the risk of  pandemic influenza illness in those who received the vaccine. This  result was confirmed in four observational studies.  Antibody-dependent  enhancement of disease has been proposed as the potentiating mechanism.

Vaccines sometimes do nothing ─ they cause no harm as they fail to protect the vaccine recipient from disease.

**Sometimes vaccines do worse than nothing** ─ they cause more cases, and more severe cases of disease in those who opt to be vaccinated.

Low levels of antibodies cannot be viewed as less of a  good thing. Ineffective vaccines are a bad thing. They stimulate low  level immune responses that sometimes potentiate the exact diseases they  were intended to prevent.

Legislation that would force the use of an ineffective vaccine must be abandoned.

But that’s not enough. The ineffective product itself must be abandoned.

According to the FDA, vaccine policy that mandates usage of an  ineffective vaccine leads to disease outbreaks in older age groups that  are more likely to suffer complications from disease.

Vaccine policy aimed at preventing outbreaks and eradicating disease  can only succeed when there is high vaccine uptake of an effective  vaccine. If one is missing, there is no point in having the other.

New vaccines are required. The continued use of some of the current,  poorly-performing vaccines, moots any perceived necessity to legislate  forced uptake, because no amount of vaccine uptake will prevent disease  outbreaks.

Even with 100% compliance, outbreaks would still occur because the  vaccines are not effective enough to provide population level immunity  sufficient to prevent epidemics.

Furthermore, outbreaks will continue to occur in older age groups  where complications from disease are more common, and mothers will have  little to no immunity to provide to their newborns during those early  critical months of life.

Individuals should have the legal right to exempt themselves and  their children from using the current products. For practical and  ethical reasons, the conversation to mandate the use of vaccines  shouldn’t even be considered until more effective products are  available.

Historically "" Reptilian men "" originated in Sumeria. There's a rare genetic skin condition which causes patches of scaly skin all over the body.

From a scientific perspective someone severely afflicted with this genetic skin condition would look very reptilian, and could logically be perceived as a "" god "" by an ancient people. As the skin condition was present within the populace ( High priests ), it must of been passed down genetically from someone severely afflicted with it. ( a god ). We can see high priests were chosen from women who had intercourse with a "" god "".

186,Deleting (Q) subs and not users has clear implications and problems,"Deleting subs that are by definition hateful, racist, etc. makes sense. But it makes no sense to delete a sub based on the actions of a few users. I read the Q subs often and I never saw all the ""inciting hate"" speech posts. The topics were interesting and often crossed with r/conspiracy. 

There were some inflamed posts on r/GreatAwakening and those subs that preceded it, and I saw quite a few deleted posts, so I imagine the mods did their job. But you can go to any sub and find questionable posts. Now TPTB (big or small), merely need to infiltrate a sub to get it removed???

To delete general subs and not users, well, what about deleting Reddit due to bad posters? Where does it end? What about removing funding methods (e.g. paypal) to stop a message? Oh wait...  Voat, Alex Jones, Wiki Leaks, etc.

Are we getting to the point where we CLEARLY can't discuss topics now? Can we talk about Q posts here? (Not to be confused with the deleting of Q subs.)

193,Who is Q anon?,"To start I would like to admit I did not follow the ""Q Movement"" up till recently


I've been watching Cosmic Disclosure since it started. If you missed it on September 11th Corey Goode recently commented on Q Anon. Claiming Q Anon is DoD (Department of Defense) I thought that was strange as I watched it but let it go.


When all the reddit banning went down. I started to think ""what is up with this Q Anon stuff?"" I randomly read this and that. Most of which seems like Pro-Trump nonsense, pushing patriotism and propaganda. 


I remember hearing Joesph P. Farrell (On Dark Journalists) saying he thinks Q's native language wasn't english or Q Anon was some kind of AI.


Recently [Simon Parkes](https://youtu.be/Ao-_gNI0grk) has come out saying Q is 4 men and an advanced AI.


So by happenstance I stumbled on [Edward Riordan](https://m.youtube.com/user/erviewer)
A trained remote veiwer who was given a blind target that ended up being Q Anon. He admits the info may be wrong. Remote viewing is not 100%. However if you watch his videos it's freaky how well the RV lines up with the previously claimed statements. At one point he sees a group of men talking in a very secure location. Discussing how to get information out about transformative advanced technology. Two lines that stand out to me ""We found it!"" &amp; ""It reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey""


8 days after Corey Goode claimed Q anon is DoD, Q Anon makes a post confirming the secret space program on September 19th. (Incase you didn't know Corey claims to of worked in the secret space program)


This leads one to believe Q Anon is a small collection of people along side an artificial intellegence working to disseminate information about transformative advanced technology and the secret space program.

This was by far the most is painful mesquito bite I've ever had.  The sound of it alone, was something I've never experienced before. It sounded as loud as a bee flying around me before biting me.

Here's a [comparison picture](https://imgur.com/a/Z5rEOdI) of the normal Aedes albopictus breed of mesquito that we normally are used to here.

This abnormally giant mesquito left a week the size of a half-dollar on me, and within an hour of being bit, my lymph nodes are noticable swollen, and I have a 102.5 degree fever.  

Having lived in this area for all my life, 35 years, I've never, ever been there victim of such an aggressive, giant mesquito attack, let alone the almost immediate side effects I'm dealing with now.

Is this a GM mesquito?  What is causing my body to all of a sudden put up it's defensive mechanism and cause my lymph nodes and fever?

Pretty normal talk about what got screwed up and then all of a sudden he’s talking about 9/11 being bullshit. I was like, woah to myself and then obviously having decent knowledge on the topic, I got into it with him. I can’t even recall what really lead to it, but he started talking about the planes not being intercepted that day and how it was BS. Got into the shadiness of the towers coming down. We branched out to a few more topics as well, including the social divide in this country. He said, if he’s in a home that’s left leaning and he puts FOX News on just to check things, they’d say, ""Oh no we don’t allow that channel on in this house"", or something to that effect. Lmao. I told him to check out James Corbett, as he’s done some great pieces on 9/11 before he left and mentioned that recent ""War Games"" one he did, so he could delve deeper into the air traffic shenanigans that day.

221,Debt As A Means Of Control,"Debt Bondage is an archaic method, during the high middle ages serfdom under feudalism was highly prevalent, and sadly, many parallels can be made from victims of days of old to debtors in the 21st century, in western society.

John Taylor illustrated the the interests of the creditor, and the debtor.

&amp;#x200B;

""One interest is a tyrant, the other its slave. In Britain, one of these interests owes to the other above ten hundred millions of pound sterling, which would require twelve million slaves to discharge, at eighty pounds sterling each... If the debtor interest amounts to ten millions of souls, and would be worth forty pounds sterling round, sold for slaves, it pays twelve and a half percentum on it's capitation value, to the creditor interest... This profit for their masters, made by those who are called freemen, greatly exceeds what is generally made by those who are called slaves""

&amp;#x200B;

To place someone in debt is obviously more profitable then ownership, a debtor does not need to be fed, housed, or clothed.

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of Americans do not own the house they live in, they belong usually in majority to corrupt financial institutions, mortgage rates have seen a very steady increase\^1, and so have interest rates for student loans.\^2.

&amp;#x200B;

Something terrifying to consider is that both mortgages, student loans, as well as medical debt is tied to LIBOR, as well as Euribor which are both open to manipulation by financial institutions, usually the same banks people are in debted too.

&amp;#x200B;

Fascism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and overpowering the state over the individual, the rise of the modern military industrial complex illustrates modern central economic planning in the united states, and the rise of state capitalism \^ 3

&amp;#x200B;

To continue favoring central planning, and abandoning individualism will inevitably lead to the serfdom of the individual, loss of freedom, and the creation of an oppressive society.

252,Why Scientism?,"We are in a metaphysical crisis. The previous sign regimes of the west, specifically Christianity embodied in the image of Christ, have been washed away and replaced with new symbols. The emblem of the cross has been superseded by flashing electric images of advertisers and Hollywood showman.

We are witnessing the dawning of a new religious order following the Nietzschean ""death of god"". The metaphysical crisis of our age was born well over one hundred years ago. We could place the pin at many events but these things happen in stages.

The electric age as it evolved brought about both the death of god, and the dawning of a new faith. The scientist of today has much in common with the priest of the past. Similar vestments even. Religion always dawns out of who has the answers to critical questions about the movement of the stars. The first astrologers who could calculate a eclipse secured the power of that guild of star gazers for millennia. Today our scientists grapple with the same questions that priests and shamans grappled with. What is life? How is it formed? And how did the world come to be? When understood it this way the theories that attempt to define the world around us, specifically evolution and the big Bang Theory are nothing more than modern day creation myths. 

The flaws in the data of both theories are well known to the average scientist. In the big bang a failure to account for the possibility of a infinite universe leaves the realm of ""empty space"" beyond what our current telescopes can detect. Hense the recent claim of ""multiple big bangs"" to reconcile the time space differential. And to the theory of evolution betting on chance and lightning to form the first rna structures or preorganisms. To get around this they begin to use the claim that a meteor with some bacteria on it seeded life on earth. .

It is easy to understand why science has become a ""cult"" when understood from a perspective of how the masses view people with critical information about the movement of the stars.

258,The Murder Of Reality,"The ‘Murder of Reality’ was written by an unknown French portrait painter around 2012. A fire-hose of dirty facts, the book claims that a secret race of seven-foot-tall reptiles MUST be controlling the world because elements of the ancient words for snake were deeply ensconced within our languages. 

Words like ‘scholar’, ‘office’ and ‘school’ were shown to embody elements of the word ‘scolex’ which was an ancient word for snake or ‘head-of-the-snake’. It makes a broad and compelling argument, but the reptilian component of the book was merely the part that piqued my interest. I believe its most valuable contribution was a reminder of ‘the forgotten recitation’.

“The Forgotten Recitation” is how the English word ‘pun’ would be translated in Aramaic. Bear in mind we’re talking about spoken language. The effect is lost in writing, after a spell has been cast. Here’s what I mean:

The words ‘prints’ and ‘prince’ are pronounced exactly the same way. Prints are something you leave behind after walking on Earth, and so is a prince. Our heirs emanate from our physical bodies, just like our hairs do. And what am I actually doing? Am I merely writing about something important, or am I trying with all my heart to RIGHT it?

There is something desperately wrong with the world, but we never talk about it because we literally can’t talk about it. We all know it. We can feel it. But we never talk about it. We can probably fix it, too - but we need to talk about it first. The situation is so serious, our most ancient spiritual practices involve 'removing one's self from the cycle of reincarnation' here on Earth. Reincarnation doesn't seem like the kind of thing we're supposed to mess with, let alone stop altogether. It will probably happen somewhere else. We need to ask ourselves why. 

Why should we try to to incarnate 'somewhere else'? Is it really that serious? The ancient texts don't really make a distinction related to what kind of life we've lived. Rich or poor, we are all encouraged to boogie. I want to know WHY. 

Why? Because I'm a man goddammit. It's my nature to fix things that are broken. It's the nature of all men to restore order, and its for this reason masculine expressions are discouraged by the PTB. True restoration of order equates to the return of paradise on Earth, which means there will be no need for power, which means those who have it aren't going to like what I have to say. After all, one cannot reign in hell if there's no chaos to reign over.

Since we can’t talk about our problem, we can’t even think about it. I’m not going to argue the merits of the Sapir-Whorf theory because imo it’s not even up for debate. The structure of language greatly influences our thoughts and behaviors, but I believe we can hack the system by remembering ‘the forgotten recitation’.

Back to the snakes or, more specifically the worms. Apparently, the words for snake and worm were very similar at one time, which isn’t surprising since those creatures look pretty much the same. The main difference though, is that snakes never invade the human body, only worms do that.

They’re not even worms per se when the invasion occurs, they’re microscopic. They come in through the mouth usually, with water or food. When this happens, we call them parasites. Parasites are something we fear naturally – for good reason.

A predator will eat us in one meal, while a parasite will eat us slowly over time. It might even grow generations of offspring inside us - living, feeding, excreting and multiplying - if we’re not careful. Parasitic relationships between species outnumber predatory relationships four-to-one, but how much do we actually know about parasites in general?

Well, for starters we can see that the word ‘parasite’ doesn’t include any of the elements referring to snakes or worms. Throughout human history we’ve had to evade and avoid all kinds of parasites, but those taking the form of worms were surely the most common. We’ve had intestinal worms, lung worms, ring worms, tapeworms…and we’ve actually seen many of them after they leave the body. 

Guinea worms plagued Europe for hundreds of years. They’re ingested with water, then they form a cyst to protect their microscopic form from the body’s defenses. There they grow into worms and when they’re ready to breed, they travel from the abdomen to the legs where they cause boils that hurt so much it caused us to seek out a pool of water for relief. This is exactly what the parasite wants. There in the water a two-foot long worm burst the boil and slowly worms its way out of the leg. If you don’t want to wait for the worm to come out by itself, you could try winding it around a stick, but if the worm breaks - you’ll turn septic and die a slow, agonizing death. Nice.

Parasites are fucking scary. Most of the ones we need worry about are worms, so why doesn’t the word parasite include any of the ancient references to worm or snake? They’re in the words that describe our educational system – why aren’t they in the word that describes the worms themselves? 

We’re told that the word parasite literally means ‘with-food’, and that it was Latin. I’ve asked several academics and they all say the same thing – with food. But they’re not talking about the way we ingest parasitic microorganisms along with our food – they’re using the word in a strictly social context. We’re supposed to believe the Latin word parasite was created to describe unwelcome free-loaders at private Roman parties – and only applied through metaphor to describe an age-old biological threat to humanity. I’m calling bullshit. 

For our ancestors who lacked microscopes and six-inch-thick books, parasites were worms. Worms were parasites. You know, in relation to human life, health, food, etc. Worms-that-are-not-found-upon-the-ground are always considered to be a threat of some sort, aren’t they?

Toxoplasma gondii remains a microorganism all its life, yet it can alter the behavior of the animals it infects to suit its own needs. When mice are infected, they lose their natural inhibitions and fear of cats, which causes them to be eaten by cats, which is the parasite’s preferred host. It has also been shown to affect human behavior by reducing our natural inhibitions. There are many parasites which totally take over the life support systems of their hosts, turning the host into nothing more than a flesh puppet for the parasite. These are studied intensively at major institutions, for obvious reasons.

So, we have this phenomenon of our existence which we call ‘parasites’, and we might define a parasite as any organism that thrives exclusively at the direct expense of another. That’s a pretty big deal. Parasites – deer ticks are a good contemporary example – must be considered evil, or bad, or the opposite of good, if the words ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are going to have any effective meaning at all. Deer ticks are actual vampires. They drink blood for a living, and there’s no other animals that depend on them for their own.

Since WE ARE THE FOOD sought by these parasites, they must be considered evil, bad, enemy - whatever. It’s really hard to describe because we don’t have an effective understanding of good and evil, but ticks could be eradicated from the environment without any ill effects. Earth is not really a delicately balanced ecosystem driven by predators. It's a carefully managed farm or prison or zoo, only in this case 'management' means handling a problem that no other farm, prison or zoo in the world has to deal with - an ever-increasing population. Forget the predators. Earth is a parasite's playground.

A fundamental understanding of good and evil is our birthright. Without it, how are we to manage self-preservation? And yet, isn’t that why God spanked Adam and Eve and kicked them out of paradise? It was because they acquired the knowledge of (the difference between) good and evil.

That’s exactly what we’re doing now.

Here’s a spoiler that a lot of you might not appreciate: Humanity embodies the definition of ‘what is good’. Any 'thing' we encounter in the world that will definitely hurt us must be considered ‘not good’. If we encounter something that’s useful towards our well-being, that thing may be considered ‘good’ for us, at that particular time, in that particular application. A thing can only be ‘good’ for something, it can’t just be considered ‘good’, but it can be considered ‘bad’ like the ticks. Where am I going with this? 

We’re going all the way - to the fucking moon.

259,Proof of a Conspiracy- What is education- Are we really educated- Who are our educators?,"In this discussion the author will, using historical evidence, build a case to provide the reader with enough information to take a second look at their education and family life in hopes of answering the question; what went wrong- why is America failing?

In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels 1848, the success of a communist revolution was outlined with multiple bullet points describing what needed to be achieved before it could proceed. Goal number four is ""Free education for all children in public schools"".

Understand that Marxism is the fanatical ideology that brings to the world stage a religious and familial war. Marxism is an atheistic philosophy that promotes global communism. It is a highly despotic political apparatus that seeks to control the destiny of the human soul.

Our current public school system is based on the Soviet model of a Marxist curriculum created to change the religious and familial values of our children to promote a global family with a hive-centric orientation through a maligned public education program.

As far back as 1798, scholars have known of a subversive conspiracy to turn the minds of our American youth by secretly penetrating into our schools with the goal to subvert the moral composition of our Christian culture with psychological techniques designed to brainwash our children at the deepest levels.

The following quote is proof that American intellectuals as far back as the 18th century knew of such a conspiracy.

In a speech given by the president of Yale University, Rev. Timothy Dwight in 1798, he spoke to New Haven churchgoers of his deep concern about the influence of the Illuminati; ""no impious sentiment of action against God has been spared; no malignant hostility against Christ and his religion has been unattempted. Justice, truth, kindness, piety, and moral obligation universally have been not merely trodden underfoot ... but ridiculed, spurned, and insulted. Is it that we may see the Bible cast into a bonfire, the vessels of the sacramental supper borne by an ass in public procession, and our children either wheedled or terrified, uniting in the mob, chanting mockeries against God and hailing to the sounds of the 'ca ira' the ruin of their religion and the loss of their souls? Shall our sons become the disciples of Voltaire (Satanist) and our daughters the concubines of the Illuminati?""

In his book Right from the Start, Pat Buchanan acknowledges a world conspiracy when he says this: ""The war between West and East is not between the economic systems of capitalism and Marxism; it is a religious war for control of the soul and destiny of mankind, the outcome of which cannot be arbitrated or negotiated.""

This subversion has been going on for a very long time, and with the creation of the Marxist ideology, it spread like wildfire. From that point forward there was a profound focus to carry this conspiracy to fruition.

A quick lesson in Russian history.

Tsarist Russia was sovereign until the beginning of the 20th century. The communists came in, destroyed this freedom and imposed their Marxist ideology. This was an ideology that was threaded into the family, schools, religion, and state. The Soviet system of communism was born.

The communists knew they needed to change the values of their new nation. They imposed a Marxist curriculum into the school system that would not allow a child to progress beyond a pre-determined point of self awareness and intellect.-*remember this (1)*

The intent of this program was to create a child that did not value family, religion, history, or self. The Soviet's wanted to create a robot in the living flesh. To produce a robot that did not have the critical thinking skills, social skills or self awareness to question what the state was doing. This was their prime directive.

This lasted for decades. Read the book The [Leipzig Connection](https://www.google.com/search?q=leipzig+connection+pdf&amp;rlz=1C1_____enUS430US430&amp;oq=leipzig+connection&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.9935j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) for an in-depth study on this Marxist psychological foundation.

Reader, this curriculum/plan was brought to America. It has been embedded into our psychological makeup since the Baby-boomers. World War's I and II were the first two majors steps taken to developed an American nation emotionally void of religious and familial values.

Conspirators vs. America WW I, II and III.

The effects of WW I, for the first time in history, American families were split forcibly by this foreign based war. Men, for the first time, were forced to leave their families for years. Women, for the first time, entered the workforce. Children, for the first time, were left at home unattended, un-fathered and un-mothered.

By the time WWII was over, the American family was fractured beyond repair. Decades of war had taken it's toll. It was now time for WWIII, a psychological war, that would forever degrade the intellect and defile the religious base of our great nation.

WW III and the computer era.

As  WW I and II came to a close technology progressed. At the dawn of WW III we saw the advent of the electronic computer (1946), the development of the [simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) of linear programming (1947), and the transistor (1948). The computer age was born.

By this time American schools were besieged with the Marxist planned alteration of history, the change in methodology of math, the understanding of science and the lowering of English language skills, to begin the process of building the corporate controlled, state sponsored, functional illiterate. 

By the 1980's, with the use of specifically made software programs, the brainwashing would intensify and subsequently be programmed into the child's soul.

The psychological effects of a perpetual WW III continue today.

If you doubt this is possible read [this article](https://www.tttruth.com/facebook-and-the-leipzig-connection/).

Here is [more proof](https://www.ed.gov/oii-news/use-technology-teaching-and-learning) of tech's infiltration into our schools.

Experience with the Soviet takeover had proven that the simplest method of securing control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant of basic system principles on one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganized, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other.

This is achieved by the following Marxist programming:

1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.

2. engaging their emotions, [increasing their self-indulgence](http://www.nea.org/tools/16963.htm) (in school since early 1900's) and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by: unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers.

3. giving them what they desire - in excess - ""junk food for thought"" - and depriving them of what they really need.

4. rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities. - *the hive*

Starting with the Millennial generation, our children have been exposed to this brainwashing at an accelerated level with the use of computer software technology.

Think about it, they grew up with computers. X-er's and Boomer's didn't. The author recollects the year 1985 when computers were brought into the classroom.

With the passage of time, the PC became the teacher and the teachers only job was reduced to validating the conclusions that the system had already pre-determined.

The purpose of all teachers, K thru college, is to validate the conclusions that the system has already pre-determined we need to arrive at.- *remember from above (1)*

If the school got their kids to arrive at the pre-determined conclusions, they got more funding from the federal government.

According to the corporation, the general rule is that there is a profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer the solution.

Here is their Marxist solution to control humanity;

Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history.

Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.

Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.

Work: Keep the public busy with no time to think.

Common Core State Standards

On June 2nd, 2010 the Introduction to the Common Core State Standards was [released](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/ccssi-introduction.pdf), although government [mandated standards](http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/development-process/) had been around since the 1990's.

How did the FED determine the qualifiers in the CCSS?

These new standards are said to be devised by the input from corporations and government, among other entities.  

""*These final standards reflect the invaluable feedback from the general public, teachers, parents,* *business leaders, states, and content area experts* *and are informed by the standards of other high performing nations*"".

In 2010, our country's parents, teachers, and general public had already been brainwashed for decades. That means multiple generations, the ones making the decisions for their own children and grandchildren, were agreeing with this new CCSS. They didn't know any better.

Why is this important?

In the CCSS, it is apparent that the only thing they are focused on is math and English language, for it states *""These English language arts and mathematics standards represent a set of expectations for student knowledge and skills that high school graduates need to master to succeed in college and careers"".*

Is this subtle? Yes.

What does it really mean? It means everything.

Is not a well rounded education necessary for a human to have a rewarding, fulfilling and spiritual life? It's about the human being, not the career. The push on career is evident. Work, work, work!

There is no mention in this manifest of American history, world history, science of any kind, nor art. There is nothing except that which the state and corporation want. Simple math for lower class and accelerated math for engineers. Add to that simple language skills for communication. That's it. Even at these CCSS levels, the par for success of these two subjects is very low. They actually teach the student to achieve the minimum.

Here's an example of how our history has been altered.

In the days of early America, the extensive study of Latin and Roman history was required for a college degree. American's readily knew that Europeans came to America and lived in America much earlier than Christopher Columbus. But in the 20th century, American history books were changed, our school children were taught that the world was considered flat, by all educated people, until Columbus discovered America.

This is still taught today. We still, as a nation, celebrate Columbus Day.

CCSS is killing our children's ability to have a rewarding prosperous life. Hope for a future according to ones familial standards and the faith in knowing they can achieve that standard with hard work, the American dream, is nearly dead or unachievable.  

How can people connect if all they know to any honest degree is math and the ability to speak?

Reader, that is the definition of a robot.

CCSS; *""Our organizations would like to thank our advisory group, which provides advice and guidance on this initiative. Additional thanks are also given to the writers of the standards, who devoted countless weekends and late nights to ensuring that the standards meet the high expectations for rigor and clarity"".*

Identify your ""advisory group and writers of the standards"" please.

*""Internationally benchmarked, so that all students are prepared for succeeding in our global economy and society"".*

This is in essence the preparation of mind for the acceptance of the One World Order managed by government and controlled by international corporations.

*These standards have been developed to be*:

• *Fewer**, clearer, and higher,* *to best drive effective policy and practice**;*

My question here is who's policy and who's standard of practice? The answer is; the state and the corporation.

*• Aligned with college and* *work expectations**, so that all students are prepared for success upon graduating from high school;*

Again, the expectation of the state government and corporations.

*• Inclusive of rigorous content and applications of knowledge through higher-order skills, so that all students are prepared for the 21 st century;*

The only skill with any marked intelligence will be low quality language and low quality math unless other subjects such as the comprehension of geology, cosmology, history, etc has been personally pursued. 

*•* *Research and evidence-based**.*  

Research; Leipzig University. Evidence; Soviet Russia and other communist regimes throughout history.

There is never any mention of a well rounded human being that knows the history of his/her country, the love of his/her family, no spiritual value what so ever.

This is a robot created to perform at the ""lowest"" level of understanding of self. However, they are looking for those who excel with the highest understanding of language and math to promote them to higher levels of the program in order to perpetuate the Marxist ideal of the One World Order. 

The family unit has be carefully disintegrated for the last 100 years. State controlled public education and state operated childcare centers have become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the child from the family at an earlier age.

Reader, the writing is on the wall. These seemingly subtle programs are slowly leaching their way into our consciousness. We have been deconstructed and dumbed down for 100 YEARS.

Charter schools are of soviet design. They are federally funded and 100% Marxist driven.

Get your kids into a private school or home school them. It's your best option.

**Chaldean Numerology: Life Path One**

The sun is what provides life. It creates order from chaos in a very real sense. For nothing is possible without it. This symbolic relationship is not unique to chaldean numerology. It has been a common theme throughout all of human history.

The Egyptians had the sun god Ra who they worshiped as the creator of all that is. In fact pharaohs would attempt to connect themselves to his lineage to increase their authority. The Greeks had a god named Helios who rode a chariot of sun around the globe. While the Romans had the god Sol.

This same relationship is present between the number one and all the rest of the other numbers. This number is a representation most importantly of your individuality and the will to survive. Secondly, it incorporates the positive aspects of your nature and within that your creative force as an individual.

There are whole subs dedicated to being the literal thought police of reddit (TMOR, FTAR).

They create a Russia boogeyman story to justify the eventual banning of their targets when in reality what was ""uncovered"" was just a few tiny websites originating in Russia getting upvoted a few times but that apparently means every mod on that subreddit is on Putin's payroll and the users of the sub are russian bots upvoting russian propaganda. It is a complete detachment from reality and a gross exaggeration of the truth. Do they really assume that everytime a trump supporter on r/t_d upvotes a positive article about trump on a small website from russia it means they are colluding with Russia actively? It is ridiculous and peanuts compared to what is really happening to reddit in terms of what they are accusing them of.

Their stated goals is to ban r/t_d and all subs associated, they are trying to target this sub as demonstrated by the ongoing brigades and attacks on the moderators of this subreddit. All conveniently timed before the midterms and as the SPLC has gotten into the action.

**Introduction**

I remember when the iconic movie ""The Dark Knight"" with Heath Ledger came out in my teens. I was never really into superheroes or Batman, but something about Heath Ledger's character inspired me, as well as millions of others, to adopt a new intrigue for...clowns, or really, the ""anti-hero."" Heath Ledger, according to USA Today, ""fueled our archvillian obsession.""

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/17/how-dark-knight-heath-ledger-fueled-our-joker-obsession/786702002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/17/how-dark-knight-heath-ledger-fueled-our-joker-obsession/786702002/)

Recently, I heard about another Joker movie being released, simply entitled ""The Joker,"" and something about it disturbed me - the ""hero"" archetype is being twisted - but why does that matter? 

Ultimately, I realized that the classic, archetypal ""Hero's Journey""  has been twisted by Hollywood to blur the lines of good and evil, and ultimately, make us sympathize for the Devil - to paint good as bad, and bad as good, and here's how.

**The Hero's Journey and Archetypes**

Nearly every movie we watch or book we read is founded on archetypes, whether they be story lines, characters, themes, or plot devices. Why are archetypes important? Well, let's look to Carl Jung for some answers: :

Nearly every movie we watch or book we read is founded on archetypes, whether they be story lines, characters, themes, or plot devices. Why are archetypes improtant? Well, let's look to Carl Jung for some answers: 

""Jung believed that everyone in the world is born with the same basic subconscious model of what a ""hero"" is, or a ""mentor"" or a ""quest,"" and that's why people who don't even speak the same language can enjoy the same stories. 

If you believe Jung, these archetypes impact us on a larger scale - they go from this ""universal subconscious"" to our conscious minds to our thoughts and actions. In other words, we may be more greatly influenced by the hidden messages in pop culture (movies, music, tv, etc.) than we realize. These archetypes play out in our lives, whether we consciously realize that or not.t can help guide them through that fear, just as Yoda guided Luke on Dagoba. If you think of a person as a computer and our bodies as ""hardware,"" language and culture seem to be the ""software."" Deeper still, and apparently common to all homo sapians, is a sort of built-in ""operating system"" which interprets the world by sorting people, places, things and experiences into archetypes.""

In other words, we may be more greatly influenced by the hidden messages in pop culture (movies, music, tv, etc.) than we realize. These archetypes play out in our lives, whether we consciuosly realize that or not.

The point of an archetype is it is rooted in our subconscious and manifests in different ways, which transcends time, culture, or language. Sure, the heroes that we have today may not look like those of Ancient Greece, but the components are still there. Batman, for example, still possesses elements of the ""archetypal hero."" But, What, if though, these archetypes are being intentionally shifted in a more sinister way? 

**Sympathy for the Devil**

Going back to the Joker, I really started to reflect on why it was bothering me so much. I thought back to the popularity of the Dark Knight, and how it really did change our view of the ""villain."" I am NOT saying that stories have never been written from the perspective of the villain; rather, this movie was different because it changed the way we *perceived* the villain. I am also NOT saying no movie has ever allowed someone to have sympathy for an evil character; rather, I am saying there has been a fundamental shift on how ""bad"" characters are portrayed. Sure, people have always had a fascination with evil, and evil characters, but it is when those lines become blurred that something disturbing happens.

In The Dark Knight, the audience subconsicously knows the Joker is literally evil. Yet, so many ended up idolizing his character, even rooting for him. That is where the problem lies.

I do not have the time or space to go through all the reasons why someone may relate to or even root for an evil character. That is not what I am getting at; **rather, I am stating the problem is that the archetypal premise of good and evil/hero and anti-hero is being completely twisted.** And while that may not have a huge impact on our daily lives as adults, it probably impacts the people who watch these movies in the first place - teens. 

If for centuries, we have subconsciously relied on the archetypal premises of good and evil to guide us moralistically in a society, what happens when these archetypes are shifted? If anything, children and teens are the ones who rely on the archetypes to build morals and character - to become good people, right?

Are we literally creating a generation that is trained to have ""sympathy for the devil?""

Before you say I am overanalyzing ""The Dark Knight,"" think about other popular movies  and characters that are aimed at changing how we view evil, from Maleficent to Darth Vader.

""Stories of old taught us that we should love heroes and hate villains. Yet that is no longer true. Baddies are becoming more complex, relatable, and - as a result - more popular.""

The article explains how the villains of today are different from those of the past: they have good looks, intelligence, wit, and even money. Are we being tricked into liking the villains?

**The Conspiracy**

You may be reading this with a sigh, wondering what I am actually getting at. So, what? Perhaps archetypes morph and evolve in time, and yes, I agree with that to a point.

However, the conspiracy is that ""they"" are purposely shifting these archetypes to ""re-program"" or even ""de-program"" some of the core values, beliefs, and morals we share, no matter who we are.

One thing I notice, today, is that many of the absurd or outlandish stories I am hearing in the media increasingly involve teens or children - from teens watching people drowning and filming it:

[https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/us/florida-teens-no-charges-drowning-man/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/us/florida-teens-no-charges-drowning-man/index.html)

to the teen who convinced her boyfriend to kill himself through texting:

[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-guilty-coercing-boyfriend-kill-himself-text-could-get-light-n788856](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-guilty-coercing-boyfriend-kill-himself-text-could-get-light-n788856)

Sure, there are a multitude of reasons as to why we are hearing more eerie cases like this, but I am wondering if something is changing in the very universal subconscious of our society that is contributing to people (not just teens) having difficulty distinguishing between good or bad, right or wrong. Further, I am emphasizing teens because I feel there has been a drastic decline the empathy of youth, as evidenced by an increasing number of bizarre cases involving pure hatred. Still, this affects everyone. 

Is pop culture solely to blame for this? Absolutely not. BUT, whether we like to admit it or not, pop culture has a tremendous impact on our values, beliefs, and morals. Examining pop culture can help us understand what the average person thinks, believes, or values. Why? Because most people are influenced by pop culture one way or another, even me and you. 

So, what skewed view of reality are children and teens growing up with today? When I was a child, Snow White was the hero, and Maleficent was the villain. Now, a child today may not distinguish between the hero and villain in this classic tale. When I was a child, Batman was Good, and the Joker was evil. What would people say today? But it goes deeper...

**The Deeper Conspiracy**

What if the ultimate hero archetype is Christ, and the ultimate anti-hero archetype villian is Satan? What if the narrative is being shifted so that we are viewing the ""hero's journey"" from the Devil's point of view? In other words, what if the very core foundations of the ""universal consciuosness"" are being twisted so that Christ is painted as evil, and the Devil is painted as good? What if the hero motif is being broken down so that we literally sympathize for the devil?

Whether you are Christian or not is not really the point of this post though. Even if you are not Christian, most can agree that qualities of Jesus  are essentially ""good"", and he is something to aspire to - again, no matter your beliefs. Could Jesus be the ultimate hero archetype, which all other heroes are built? 

""The story of Jesus Himself serves as a metanarrative, an overarching or master story, for heroism. Christ has always been a true hero. Heroism founded in Christ transcends time and culture. All literary heroes will either parody or mirror the pattern set by Christ. Thus, Jesus can be established as a hub for all types of heroism. The commonality of the stories that we read and write, from Wuthering Heights to Virgil’s Aeneid to the Chronicles of Narnia, points to the existence of a greater story and a higher hero—one that transcends human imagination.""

If you were the Devil, wouldn't you have to shift the overarching hero archetype so that people would be distracted, misguided, and ultimately, led away from the true hero, Savior, or Redeemer? 

**Conclusion**

This post is just a premise. I am not claiming I have 100% proof that this is happening, and as always, I write so that we can discuss, and I can hear your thoughts. Please read discuss with an open mind! 

Still, if you look at the world today, it seems ""down is the new up."" Everything feels upside down, and it really is as if the lines between good and bad are becoming more and more blurred. Is one movie or song or book responsible for this? No, absolutely not. But, I would argue the structure of our society is breaking down, which is having a profound impact on what we view as ""right or wrong."" I am arguing that when the things we connect with are built on blurred lines, like art, literature, or movies, our society will be, too.

321,Are these the only mainstream mentions of WTC 7?,"Can  anyone provide more exceptions than the following that no global  mainstream sources will acknowledge WTC 7, and that even many 9/11  investigators ([e.g. Philip Marshall](https://endofinnocence.com/big-bamboozle-philip-marshall-controlled-opposition-murder-suicide/)) began directing people away from the existence of WTC 7?

Sure,  there was some discussion the first few days, and Larry Silverstein  said in an interview later that they decided to pull it, and John Kerry  got ambushed and said he thought it was a controlled demolition (of  course, there was no official story yet), and now we have the new  mainstream study claiming that WTC 7 could not have been brought down by  fire (maybe the blackout is lifting in order to deny there has been a  blackout?).

We also have these two cases:

Case 1:

Geraldo Rivera seemed to accept that WTC 7 had to be a controlled demolition in his show on 11/13/2010: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-OfVkka1Yk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-OfVkka1Yk)

Then Geraldo walked it back and bashed ""conspiracy theorists"" a few days later: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uQSX2VMcT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uQSX2VMcT0)

Case 2:

This  Russian news source shows an image of WTC 7 collapsing, which is more  than the MSM have done in any other cases I am aware of, but I don't  know how mainstream this sources is,, I don't know what the video says,  and the article does not mention WTC 7. Also, the article says that  9/11/2001 happened 15 days ago.

These  few cases constitute an impossibly small amount of mainstream people  mentioning WTC 7 given that 10 seconds of common video prove the  official story cannot be true, which is earth-shattering, and which is  self-evident to anyone with the minimal necessary intelligence and  experience (a significant minority). To just about everyone else, at  least it looks exactly like a controlled demolition, even if they lack  the minimal capabilities for it to be self-evident. Therefore, the idea  that no one else in the mainstream has mentioned it--not even Muslims or  enemies of America or Israel--is impossible ... without a globally  dominant cabal.",conspiracy,1537656160,JimAtEOI,18,13,True,2018-09-22

324,[Announcement] Update on the removal of /u/illuminatedwax and subsequent mod list kerfuffle,"[The original announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9hmhps/announcement_top_mod_uilluminatedwax_has_been/) was de-stickied pending an update from the admins, which has now been provided.

To re-summarize: /u/illuminatedwax was a long-standing /r/conspiracy moderator who was also an original reddit ""power user"" that moderated dozens of very large subs. 

IW has had minimal activity on reddit over the last few years, and his last comment on /r/conspiracy was in 2013. 

A requirement for inclusion on the /r/conspiracy mod team is to actually engage with the community here, and since inactive mods have been removed in the past, there's no reason why IW should've been treated any differently.

However, as the moderator in the ""top"" spot, the only way to have him removed was by contacting the admins (reddit employees). In addition, we needed to show that we, as a mod team, made a good faith effort to contact IW. 

Approximately 3 months ago, the entirety of the /r/conspiracy mod team reached out to IW on multiple occasions, attempting to establish any form of contact. When he failed to reply, we documented our attempts for the admins (a required step). 

This is when things went a bit awry: After we had been given final approval from the admins, I was instructed to submit a redditrequest, which I obliged. 

Naturally, the mod team had planned to announce the impending removal of IW when the admins gave us the thumbs up, but instead we were apparently hit by a *bug* of all things that immediately removed the *entire* mod team and kept only me.

To say that this was an unexpected development would be an understatement.

When this happened, I immediately checked the modmail to see which of the now ex-mods had any recent activity on reddit and I invited them. By the end of the night, half a dozen or so of the active ex-mods had been reinvited. 

Because restoring the mod team to its previous order would be very difficult to coordinate (each mod would need to be online at the same time), we reached out to the admins again for help. The following morning, they stepped in and restored the list.

In addition, we've been provided this explanation for the strangeness that occurred:

&gt;Thank you all for your understanding!

&gt;Just to follow up on what happened here. We [recently automated](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/942xo4/coming_soon_an_upgrade_to_request_bot_and_some/) some of handling on reddit request, and unfortunately your request surfaced a teeny tiny little bug. ;)

&gt;It seems the bot thought 'if valid request to remove inactive top mod, then remove all moderators and throw a [popcorn party](https://i.redd.it/459sgsq7nun11.gif)'. We've now righted the bot and took away it's popcorn privileges for the foreseeable future. Sorry again for the chaos, but thanks for helping surface the issue so it won't happen again!

I hope this clears up a lot of the understandable confusion!

**Introduction**

I remember when the iconic movie ""The Dark Knight"" with Heath Ledger came out in my teens. I was never really into superheroes or Batman, but something about Heath Ledger's character inspired me, as well as millions of others, to adopt a new intrigue for...clowns, or really, the ""anti-hero."" Heath Ledger, according to USA Today, ""fueled our archvillian obsession.""

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/17/how-dark-knight-heath-ledger-fueled-our-joker-obsession/786702002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/17/how-dark-knight-heath-ledger-fueled-our-joker-obsession/786702002/)

Recently, I heard about another Joker movie being released, simply entitled ""The Joker,"" and something about it disturbed me - the ""hero"" archetype is being twisted - but why does that matter? 

Ultimately, I realized that the classic, archetypal ""Hero's Journey""  has been twisted by Hollywood to blur the lines of good and evil, and ultimately, make us sympathize for the Devil - to paint good as bad, and bad as good, and here's how. 

*Just to caution, this post is just a PREMISE and there is some conjecture...ultimately, let's discuss, even if you disagree. : )*

Below is a copy of the text. Enjoy: 
Conventional Militaries are changing in our modern times to accommodate a global change that is brought by the emergence of globalization. Militaries are no longer facing a conventional threat, and must become unconventional in nature in order to oppose Guerilla forces and ideals in a battle of fourth generational warfare. Militaries have outsourced their own forces to Multinational Corporations. This is part of a strategy envisioned, in part, by the World Justice Project. Also, militaries are making strong advancements in low-intensity operations such as cyber warfare, which has been called the fifth dimension of warfare (The Economist).

Globalization may be defined as increasing unification of the world's economic order through reduction of such barriers to international trade as tariffs, export fees, and import quotas. The goal is to increase material wealth, goods, and services through an international division of labor by efficiencies catalyzed by international relations, specialization and competition. It describes the process by which regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through communication, transportation, and trade. The term is most closely associated with the term economic globalization: the integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, foreign direct investment, capital flows, migration, the spread of technology, and military presence.

In his Article “Past and Present,” published in a March 2010 volume of Economic Affairs, Dilip K. Das admits that, “Although the three terms – globality, globalism and globalization – are often narrowly defined in their economic meaning, they are broad in their meaning and implications.” The definition of the term can, more realistically, accommodate the transition from national sovereignty to intranational central government, the emergence of a world military, and the development of a global worldview. Take, for instance, the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America which goes so far as to unite national defense strategies between three countries (Ackleson &amp; Kastner).

Lincoln P. Bloomfield, who is currently a Professor of Political Science at MIT, was contracted by the United States Defense Department, in 1961, to write a thesis which envisioned a world effectively controlled by the United Nations. He quickly mentioned that “the notion of a ""UN-controlled world is today a fantastic one” (Chapter 1). He said that, because at the time the idea of a central world government was radical and unrealistic. However, he sought to find a way to make it a reality. In doing so he took part in changing the structure of military powers in the world, and enacted trends which would reduce national militaries, replacing them with a world military force (Chapter 4).

Bloomfield also recognized something very key to the plan for world control. Having layed out many conflicts which would enter onto the world stage in later years, he hypothesized on the end of conventional conflict altogether. He knew that one day there would no longer be a need for conventional armies, and that a new threat would emerge- the threat of Guerilla Warfare (Chapter 6). Such a conflict would take a military out of the realm of third-generational warfare and into the realm of fourth-generation warfare.

“Then came the fourth generation, say the theory’s proponents, in which decentralization and initiative carry over from the third generation, but war changes in that states lose their monopoly on violence and are forced to fight non-state opponents” (Junio). Today we can see that Bloomfield was right. We have wrapped up all major conventional conflicts.. The main struggle in our current conflict is not between national armies, but between a coalition of mixed forces and forces that are ambiguous as to national involvement. This new realm of conflict has caused militaries to explore new avenues including cyberwarfare, network-centric warfare, low intensity operations, counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency.

”Throughout history new technologies have revolutionized warfare, sometimes abruptly, sometimes only gradually: think of the chariot, gunpowder, aircraft, radar and nuclear fission. So it has been with information technology. Computers and the internet have transformed economies and given Western armies great advantages, such as the ability to send remotely piloted aircraft across the world to gather intelligence and attack targets. But the spread of digital technology comes at a cost: it exposes armies and societies to digital attack.

The threat is complex, multifaceted and potentially very dangerous. Modern societies are ever more reliant on computer systems linked to the internet, giving enemies more avenues of attack. If power stations, refineries, banks and air-traffic-control systems were brought down, people would lose their lives. Yet there are few, if any, rules in cyberspace of the kind that govern behavior, even warfare, in other domains. As with nuclear- and conventional-arms control, big countries should start talking about how to reduce the threat from cyberwar, the aim being to restrict attacks before it is too late” (The Economist).

“Low intensity conflict is a political-military confrontation between contending states or groups below conventional war and above the routine, peaceful competition among states. It frequently involves protracted struggles of competing principles and ideologies. Low intensity conflict ranges from subversion to the use of armed force. It is waged by a combination of means, employing political, economic, informational, and military instruments. Low intensity conflicts are often localized, generally in the Third World, but contain regional and global security implications” (US Army FM 100-20).

Counterterrorism is a response to a force which threatens the livelihood of people everywhere. It has been a strategy of national forces for a long time, but before the September 11th attacks in New York in 2001 it had not been on the forefront of public attention. Since then many armies around the world have adapted to the changes that such a conflict has brought to the table. Instead of having a well defined enemy to attack, militaries have an invisible enemy that could strike at any moment, and once the strike is launched it is often too late to stop. Therefore forces must work to make themselves harder targets and also gather intelligence which will direct them in capturing and arresting terrorists before its too late (Kolodkin).

Counterinsurgency is largely related to counterterrorism, but adds a few details. It implies that a large force of invisible enemies, existing in any or all countries of the world, are hostile towards a particular government or nation-state. “The United States possesses overwhelming conventional military superiority. This capability has pushed its enemies to fight U.S. forces unconventionally, mixing modern technology with ancient techniques of insurgency and terrorism. Most enemies either do not try to defeat the United States with conventional operations or do not limit themselves to purely military means. They know that they cannot compete with U.S. forces on those terms. Instead, they try to exhaust U.S. national will, aiming to win by undermining and outlasting public support” (FM 23-4). Many times, Army leaders that don’t focus on an understanding of the nature of 4GW conflict fail in their missions. “Western militaries too often neglect the study of insurgency. They falsely believe that armies trained to win large conventional wars are automatically prepared to win small, unconventional ones. In fact, some capabilities required for conventional success—for example, the ability to execute operational maneuver and employ massive firepower—may be of limited utility or even counterproductive in COIN operations. Nonetheless, conventional forces beginning COIN operations often try to use these capabilities to defeat insurgents; they almost always fail.”

“Out go all the U.S. troops by year’s end, President Obama said Friday about Iraq. And in go the contractors…As the United States pulls out its remaining 50,000 or so troops after a decade of conflict costing around $1 trillion, many of the soldiers’ non-fighting functions will be pursued by a force of State Department-funded government contractors expected to near 15,000” (Smith). Nearly every component of the Army’s operations have been outsourced to contractors. Mechanics, security guards, construction crews and even intelligence services are now a major component supplementing military strategy. The contractors get paid much more than the troops themselves, but they have the ability to operate in Iraq- for instance- after the US Army is gone. This trend of contracting forces is an ever increasing one, and I believe it will shape the future of operations around the world. This trend is essentially a transition from national militaries to intranational forces. Instead of being an intranational Army governed by a central authority, we have the complex notion of a conglomerate of multinational corporations working with groups of individual nations.

Another change that is likely to affect the US Army is the issue of retirements. The Army wants to make it so that retirements are based on a 401K style plan rather than the current 20 year commitment guarantee. I see this as being, at least partially, an effect of globalization. With all the other changes to the military being considered, it’s not hard to see that the future of warfare does not require such a large conventional military. Just the announcement of the possibility of this plan has 80 percent of the soldiers I’ve talked to saying they are getting out of the military as soon as they possibly can. Also, the force that is left will be one with a high rate of turnover, encouraging a flexible and adaptive military that can be compartmentalized to many areas of the world at once.

The world is changing, and the militaries of every country in the world are scrambling to make the appropriate adjustments to their operational strategies. With the end to conventional warfare upon us, we have stepped into a new era of warfare- one with new enemies, and fought with new tactics. Also, with the transition towards intranational forces I find myself wondering if we will even have an army ten years from now. Perhaps we will have one, but whether we do or not I’m sure that we’ll see it act as a part of a larger coalition force, and will not be a sole actor. Whatever path we take it is my hope that we can war to end war, because the object of war must eventually be peace.

392,Regarding Rosenstein and the scope of the Special Counsel,"What is Robert Mueller investigating, exactly?

In May 2017, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as Special Counsel to oversee an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and related matters, essentially continuing previous counterintelligence investigation(s).

Rosenstein's 5/17/2017 authorization [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3726408-Rosenstein-letter-appointing-Mueller-special.html).

However, as we learned [only in spring 2018](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/US-v-Manafort-full-text-transcript-hearing-motion-may-4-2018.pdf),  Rosenstein sent another memo to Mueller on August 2, 2017, titled 'The Scope of Investigation and Definition of Authority' (see [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4429989-Rod-Rosenstein-memo-outlining-scope-of-Mueller.html). You can read some lines about Manafort and Ukraine etc, but three-quarters of a page of the memo is completely blacked out. Redacted.

Thus, we have no idea what Mueller is investigating... right?

However, it's noteworthy that DAG Rosenstein issued the memo [on the same day as Wray was sworn in as the FBI Director.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-sessions-swearing-fbi-director-chris-wray), that is when McCabe was no acting director of the FBI anymore.

394,"Social Justice, Cultural Marxism, and the Eroding Of Democracy","Social Justice has been a concept in western philosophy for millennia, having been wrote of by Plato and Socrates, neoliberalism and progressive thinking sadly has twisted it into a harmful social concept. Social Justice infact in harmful to democracy, socialism, and capitalism. We must also ask who funds these groups, where did their origins begin?

&amp;#x200B;

""  including the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in *Civiltà Cattolica*, based on the work of St. Thomas Aquinas. He argued that rival capitalist and socialist theories, based on subjective Cartesian thinking, undermined the unity of society present in Thomistic metaphysics as neither were sufficiently concerned with moral philosophy. Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, John Stuart Mill stated in *Utilitarianism* his view that ""Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge."" 

&amp;#x200B;

This argument will consider that Social Justice has roots in resource equity, fairness, and a respect for diversity. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" *As I see it, social justice requires resource equity, fairness, and respect for diversity, as well as the eradication of existing forms of social oppression. Social justice entails a ""redistribution"" of resources from those who have ""unjustly"" gained them to those who justly deserve them, and it also means creating and ""ensuring"" the processes of truly democratic participation in decision-making.... It seems clear that only a ""decisive"" redistribution of resources and decision-making power can ""ensure"" social justice and authentic democracy*. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Equality both promotes fairness and calls for a respect for diversity, but sadly, there is a dangerous conflict between equality and liberty, most promote liberty as the absence of coersion.

&amp;#x200B;

"" *Even Rousseau conceded that broad natural inequalities exist at birth. This fact has seemed evident to all men at all times, aside from certain skeptics in the last century. Many philosophers or theologians have affirmed the theoretical or theological equality of man at birth; however, few have argued that men are born equal in all capacities. The concept of natural equality of rights is a product of the natural law school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Nineteenth century socialists, with ""social justice"" as their measure of reality, worked out some attractive conclusions from the assumption that men are born equal in all capacities, so they decided their premise must be true. Lenin’s plans for the end of the division of labor, allowing all men to do all jobs, is a typical example.* ""

&amp;#x200B;

Natural Inequality is often argued, but sadly it is very true. More men commit crime than women, more men commit suicide than women, Caucasians have at average higher IQs than Africans And African Americans, women are weaker than men. These facts and thousands other strongly contradict the belief that equality is ideal, or desirable.

&amp;#x200B;

Karl Marx's economic theory described the inevitable overthrow of a capitalist society, he believed capitalism would eventually create massive inequality between the rich, and the poor. The final stage of this overthrow would culminate in a utopian, classless, and egalitarian society. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many strong parallels can be highlighted between modern social justice, and marxist philosophy. Cultural Hegemony is considered by marxist philosophy to be a hindrance to total acceptance of marxism and the eventual overthrow of the ruling class. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sites of Cultural Hegemony as defined by Marxist Hegemony are commonly targeted by modern Social Justice Groups, some of these sites/instituions are 

* religon
* education
* political parties
* trade unions
* communications
* culture 

Historically, atheism has been dominated by the secular left, the domination has gone so far that recently Richard Dawkins was deplatformed for ""Abusive Speech"" by social justice organizations. Education has similarly been infiltrated, I could sit here and think of a million different ways social justice has infiltrated these sites, but if you don't believe me, I'll provide them.

&amp;#x200B;

It is my belief Social Justice is just another method of complete subversion, and it is working, many of their tactics closely mirror those of soviet cultural subversion, and it is very obvious.

This argument will consider that Social Justice has roots in resource equity, fairness, and a respect for diversity.

"" *As I see it, social justice requires resource equity, fairness, and respect for diversity, as well as the eradication of existing forms of social oppression. Social justice entails a ""redistribution"" of resources from those who have ""unjustly"" gained them to those who justly deserve them, and it also means creating and ""ensuring"" the processes of truly democratic participation in decision-making.... It seems clear that only a ""decisive"" redistribution of resources and decision-making power can ""ensure"" social justice and authentic democracy*. ""

Equality both promotes fairness and calls for a respect for diversity, but sadly, there is a dangerous conflict between equality and liberty, most promote liberty as the absence of coersion.

"" *Even Rousseau conceded that broad natural inequalities exist at birth. This fact has seemed evident to all men at all times, aside from certain skeptics in the last century. Many philosophers or theologians have affirmed the theoretical or theological equality of man at birth; however, few have argued that men are born equal in all capacities. The concept of natural equality of rights is a product of the natural law school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Nineteenth century socialists, with ""social justice"" as their measure of reality, worked out some attractive conclusions from the assumption that men are born equal in all capacities, so they decided their premise must be true. Lenin’s plans for the end of the division of labor, allowing all men to do all jobs, is a typical example.* ""

Natural Inequality is often argued, but sadly it is very true. More men commit crime than women, more men commit suicide than women, Caucasians have at average higher IQs than Africans And African Americans, women are weaker than men. These facts and thousands other strongly contradict the belief that equality is ideal, or desirable.

Karl Marx's economic theory described the inevitable overthrow of a capitalist society, he believed capitalism would eventually create massive inequality between the rich, and the poor. The final stage of this overthrow would culminate in a utopian, classless, and egalitarian society.

Many strong parallels can be highlighted between modern social justice, and marxist philosophy. Cultural Hegemony is considered by marxist philosophy to be a hindrance to total acceptance of marxism and the eventual overthrow of the ruling class.

Sites of Cultural Hegemony as defined by Marxist Hegemony are commonly targeted by modern Social Justice Groups, some of these sites/instituions are

* religon
* education
* political parties
* trade unions
* communications
* culture

Historically, atheism has been dominated by the secular left, the domination has gone so far that recently Richard Dawkins was deplatformed for ""Abusive Speech"" by social justice organizations. Education has similarly been infiltrated, I could sit here and think of a million different ways social justice has infiltrated these sites, but if you don't believe me, I'll provide them.

It is my belief Social Justice is just another method of complete subversion, and it is working, many of their tactics closely mirror those of soviet cultural subversion, and it is very obvious.",conspiracy,1537709541,129321,12,0,True,2018-09-23

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The SEC has not quantified the number of active cases in which substantial files were destroyed. Reuters news service and the Los Angeles Times published reports estimating them at 3,000 to 4,000. They include the agency’s major inquiry into the manner in which investment banks divvied up hot shares of initial public offerings during the high-tech boom. The EEOC said documents from about 45 active cases were missing and could not be easily retrieved from any backup system.""*

&amp;#x200B;

It is unclear whether or not these files contained enron case files, the trial which took place a few months later relied on little evidence, consisting of mainly testimony.

*Ruemmler noted each of the witnesses “came in and owned up to what they did,” while Lay and Skilling offered excuses, claimed memory lapses and pointed to statements by accountants and lawyers that Enron’s inner workings were proper.*

*The trial produced little hard evidence against the defendants, leaving jurors to decide whom to believe.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Kenneth Lay, the ceo of Enron, and it's founder was a good friend of the Bush Family, he was close to becoming the Treasury Secretary of Enron, 

""  *Some two dozen letters written by Lay to then-Gov. Bush were among the 350 pages of Bush documents released Friday by Texas archivists in response to requests by news organizations and the nonprofit government watchdog group Public Citizen. In another one, Lay thanks Bush for a Christmas ornament depicting the Texas Capitol, saying: ""It was a thoughtful gift and one our family will enjoy hanging on the tree every year.""*

 *Lay's primary concern in the correspondence was electricity deregulation. Although Bush -- who once nicknamed Lay ""Kenny Boy"" -- signed a state law deregulating the electricity market in 1999, the documents do not indicate that his actions were in response to Lay's interests.*""

The TAPI pipeline (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India)  was promoted by an Argentinian oil company named Bridas, the Centgas consortium was promoted by UNOCAL. and Robert Oakley  (The Ambassador to Pakistan under George H.W Bush) was sent to Afghanistan to convince the Taliban to choose Centgas for construction of the pipeline.

&amp;#x200B;

Enron had hoped to be chosen for construction of the pipeline, infact, Enron executives met with Taliban officials in mid 2001, 

&amp;#x200B;

*"" The Associated Press will later report that the Enron corporation bribes Taliban officials as part of a “no-holds-barred bid to strike a deal for an energy pipeline in Afghanistan.” Atul Davda, a senior director for Enron’s International Division, will later claim, “Enron had intimate contact with Taliban officials.” Presumably this effort began around 1996, when a power plant Enron was building in India ran into trouble and Enron began an attempt to supply it with natural gas via a planned pipeline through Afghanistan (see* [*1995-November 2001*](http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a062496enron#a95enronlobbying) *and* [*June 24, 1996*](http://historycommons.org/item.jsp?item=a062496enron)*). In 1997, Enron executives privately meet with Taliban officials in Texas (see* [*December 4, 1997*](http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a062496enron#a120497texasvisit)*). They are “given the red-carpet treatment and promised a fortune if the deal \[goes\] through.” It is alleged Enron secretly employs CIA agents to carry out its dealings overseas. According to a CIA source, “Enron proposed to pay the Taliban large sums of money in a ‘tax’ on every cubic foot of gas and oil shipped through a pipeline they planned to build.” This source claims Enron paid more than $400 million for a feasibility study on the pipeline and “a large portion of that cost was pay-offs to the Taliban.” Enron continues to encourage the Taliban about the pipeline even after Unocal officially gives up on the pipeline in the wake of the African embassy bombings (see* [*December 5, 1998*](http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a062496enron#a120598unocalwithdraw)*). An investigation after Enron’s collapse in 2001 (see* [*December 2, 2001*](http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a062496enron#a120201enron)*) will determine that some of this pay-off money ended up funding al-Qaeda. ""*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The USA would later halt all pipeline negotiations as Americans embassies had been bombed, as the Taliban had endorsed Osama Bin Laden, the Bush Presidency would need to find a reason to rid Afghanistan of Al-Qaeda, and they found it a few months later.

&amp;#x200B;

*"" The United States alleged that* [*Osama bin Laden*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden) *was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader,* [*Mullah Omar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Omar)*, announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support.

416,Proof- EPA Increased Permissible Radiation Limits Post Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown,"&amp;#x200B;

The Environmental Protection Agency is managed by an appointee as part of the Presidential Cabinet. Most appointee's are super-wealthy corporate leaders and former lobbyists that have titles like CEO, CFO, COO, Banker, etc. This is where the bulk of all federal governmental corruption is seated as these are the supreme project developers.

The appointee's title is the Administrator of the EPA. The responsibilities include managing existing [environmental statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_environmental_statutes) as well as upgrading current policy and creating new policy. So his/her job is to make sure everyone is acting in the best interest of the environment in order to promote healthy living standards for the public and wildlife in general.

This is obviously a very important responsibility as billions of lives depend on it's proper operation. But, as we will see, the UNITED STATES INC, the democratic corptocracy that we live in, is completely apathetic in it's role.

Reader, let's go back to March 16th, 2011 Fukushima Prefecture Japan and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant [meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster).

The focus here is not the occurrence itself or what led to it, but the subsequent governmental handling of this unprecedented manmade catastrophe.

Since the meltdown, Fukushima has contaminated 33% of the worlds oceans. This flow of radioactive water has reached the west coast of the UNITED STATES.

This is absolutely of grave concern on all levels and needs to be dealt with on a massive scale to prevent health hazards. There is no doubt this will affect drinking water and food resources. This is where the EPA comes in, or so you would think.

In July 2016 the EPA, under the direction of  (D-MA) [Gina McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_McCarthy), proposed a [controversial plan](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01230/revision-to-the-pag-manual-protective-action-guide-pag-for-drinking-water-after-a-radiological) to allow vastly greater radioactive contamination in drinking water than permitted by the Safe Drinking Water Act for an unspecified period that may last for [years](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/pagfactsheet-2016.pdf). To get this through Gina hid the plan’s effects, blocked commenter's from including their identities on documents in an extraordinary move that reduces specific public input from a range of experts. Gina also stifled the ability to put said documents on the record by limiting the size of documents.

EPA actually made it next to impossible for any expert organization to get their repudiation not only recorded but viewed as scientific expertise.

The newly enhanced [EPA upgrade](https://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/ultra-high-radiation-coming-to-your-drinking-water.html) to the Safe Drinking Water Act would permit radiation exposures equivalent to 250 chest X-rays in a year. In essence a person could receive a lifetime dosage of radiation from a small glass of water.

Over 60,000 comment letters from members of the public, state and local emergency response and health organizations, environmental advocates, industry associations and other stakeholders were submitted. Most of the comment letters expressed concerns with the proposed guidance. 

In this [document](https://www.peer.org/assets/docs/7-26-63OrganizationsPAGsComments.pdf), it shows conclusively the shady practice of the EPA. In one instance it observes ""One can understand why EPA might wish to keep the public from seeing the other radionuclide concentrations it proposes to allow in their drinking water. The values previously proposed, which did become public, were, for some radionuclide's, tens of thousands of times higher than EPA’s MCLs; some were hundreds of thousands of times higher; one was more than a million times higher.19 Given that the three radionuclide's for which EPA does now provide proposed concentrations have even higher levels than those proposed in 2009, one can surmise that were EPA to disclose the figures for the rest it could be apparent that they exceed MCLs by even larger amounts"".

EPA has been raising the acceptable levels of radiation in our food and water supply for years. They are systematically justifying pumping the bar behind the scene while admitting that even at lower levels radiation causes health problems. All of this to disarm the public of a very real hazard that began with the nuclear era of the 50's.

Reader, when have you ever heard any government leader talk about any level of radiation in our food and water supply as a consequence of nuclear proliferation? And how as time passes, the EPA, as a failsafe, raises the safety limits of human ingestion to keep up with the increased exposure.

The corptocracy in which we live is all about the money and power politics brings to the leadership. It has nothing to do with ""we the people"". Instead of addressing the real problem, the EPA increases our permissible dose of radiation to fit their model as if we were firmware upgrading to a software adjustment.

The federal government is poisoning us in every way possible, legally.

424,Brotherhood Of The Bell AKA B.o.B,"The majority of people worldwide do not know what the terms Black Operations and Black Sciences mean or how they are used.

Black Operations were developed after World War I, but really 
flourished after World War II during the Cold War. Congress 
allocated money to the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and other Defense 
Department sectors to make the United States military as strong 
as possible, but certain projects became more secretive than 
others. The more secret projects were funded by the civilian 
sector at first, such as pet peeve, with defense contractors 
already in the loop.

As time went on, the ""privy“ developed into a real clique of 
not only specially screened corporations, but also choice 
individuals found by federal talent hunts. A new sub-culture 
was born with a new personality and belief system, completely 
cut off from mainstream Americans.

Cutting-edge technology such as the stealth aircraft, invisible 
hover-craft, extremely low frequency mind control (ELF) and 
weather control, in addition to the cloning or reproduction of 
identical species, became ”Secret Sciences’

The new knowledge wasn‘t, and still is not, available to the 
regular Army, to Congress, or to any University. The most 
secret of the secret was in the hands of a power hungry few 
that tied itself to the World Bank for the future funding of 
its projects. They developed ”think-tanks‘ like Stanford 
Research Institute and Tavistock to keep the masses fooled 
about virtually everything.

The deception grew like a cancer into every area of 
industrialized society. They moved into everything - from the 
Mafia, to Harvard University, to International Banking. They 
learned how to control the media, and thus, they controlled 
television, Hollywood, every newspaper, every educational 
institution and every person‘s mind at least to a certain 
point.

Accusations of abuse and inhuman acts by the C.I.A. and F.B.I. 
were investigated by Congress in 1977. These agencies used the 
excuse of ”national security"" for every crime they committed. 
Under the guise of ”national security‘ there has not been an 
investigation of their highly illegal activities since 1977. 
Your Congress, your President and your Supreme Court are 
actually scared of them. A mountain of evidence points to the 
fact that they have killed thousands, including corporate 
executives and politicians - perhaps JFK.

Thus, they are considered the ""Invisible Government“!

The ""Invisible Government“ needs a name at this point, so let 
us call it, The Brotherhood of the Bell. This was a 1960s 
movie. By the way, Bell Corporation made the first flying 
saucer called ”The Bell‘ - for the Invisible Government - 
because it was shaped like a bell.

Therefore, I shall call the Brotherhood of the Bell
- simply B.O.B.

B.O.B. became an internationally funded and operated 
organization that developed its totalitarian tactics for 
worldwide economic, political and military control. B.O.B. led 
us to believe that half of the earth was religious-capitalism, 
defended by the CIA and the other half of the world was 
atheist-communist, defended by the KGB.

But, in actuality, the International Bankers and ancient 
esoteric secret societies - with an octopus of intelligence 
agencies - controlled the entire earth, even through World Wars 
I and II. Whenever a few cliques decided to go into business 
for themselves and break away from the monopoly system, we 
would have a world war. The same is true today, so be 
forewarned; do not mess with the super bankers!

The Cold War ended because of a worldwide cry for ”peace"".
The old industrialist/banker game of churning up yet another 
war for the military/industrial complex was becoming more and 
more difficult. Their ”think tanks"" had to come up with a new 
strategy to subdue this ”New Left"" ideology.

Time also changed technology, thus the bankers and 
industrialists no longer needed large populations to do the 
farming, work in the factories or even fight in their war-
machine game. Advanced computers, robots and artificial 
intelligence, bio-electronics and cloning eliminated the need 
of all of these ”useless eaters‘. Top secret meetings were held 
and a strategy initiated (as early as 1960).

One such example is found in ""The Report from Iron Mountain“.

The ”New Left,"" with all of its altruistic and humanitarian 
concepts, would be the ”Trojan Horse"" that would bring in the 
largest shadow of death to fall on mankind in the written 
history of the earth. ”Globalist"" books reveal the hidden 
agenda behind the United Nations, the covert meanings of their 
statues and art at the new Masonic airports, and their shrines 
like the Georgia Guide Stones.

All of these items call for a massive depopulation of the earth!

They also propose the elimination of democracy and culture, 
under the guise of a new positive program devised by one of 
their ”think-tanks‘. The Proposed Agenda – A one-world 
religion, a one-world government - In other words, a New World 
Order. How many times have we had that repetitive phrase thrust 
into our faces?

On the other hand, certain racist ”New Right‘ organizations 
have been, and are currently, manipulated by the Black Ops 
agent provocateurs. Their motivation is to make these groups 
appear hostile to the masses through their ”Song Bird‘ media.

The truth is that these groups are very aware of certain 
concepts of the New World Order, but, they cannot see that they 
being used as ""scapegoats and patsies“ for Black Operations‘ 
sabotage. The invisible government always uses some sort of 
instigated chaos to steer public demand for social change.
Gun control is a perfect example of this!

Their hoodwinking games are from the old Masonic term, ”Ordo 
Abo Chao."" They covertly create the problem, but their 
politicians come forward publicly with the perfect solution: 
Order Out of Chaos.

B.O.B.‘s old mantra was national security,
its excuse for cruelty to mankind.

Now, there are a whole string of pacifications like:
""To save the children“ or ""To save nature!“

The truth is that The Brotherhood of the Bell is destroying 
more nature with its top secret projects like the nuclear bomb, 
chemical and biological warfare and HAARP (High-Frequency 
Active Auroral Research Program), than we, the ”useless 
eaters,‘ could ever imagine doing.

When the Berlin wall came down, the Black Operations of the 
East merged with the Black Operations of the West. The ”think 
tanks‘ now include the Soviets and Red Chinese. They have mixed 
their ideas for a One World Order with military Special Forces; 
this combination in scheming collusion in order to execute 
their ”cleansing or killing field"" immoral programs.

What these Brave New World types do not know is that, once 
again, they are being used to satisfy the greedy appetites of 
the Super Power Elite. Those in the Cabal know that an inter-
dimensional society, an etheric civilization more invisible 
than they are, control their minds and souls.

They honor these Ascended Masters or Gods with blood and 
sacrifice, as they always have, through their history of the 
Dark Nobility and Black Arts Occultism.

They know the Lord of this earth is Lucifer
or the Dark Forces, and that he must be appeased.

The ”Black Budget"" then started to be used for the ”Black Arts"" 
and became known as the Black Sciences. The earliest projects 
actually started prior to World War I, while the more popular 
ones started around World War II. The U.S. Army‘s Manhattan 
Project was in charge of making the A-bomb, while U.S. Navy
dealt with Stealth equipment and invisibility, as 
evidenced in the Philadelphia Experiment
(Written about in both these volumes).

After the war, the scientists of both projects were joined with 
Nazi scientists from Germany and NASA.

From this merging, the National Security Agency was officially 
inaugurated. Previous experiments like ”Babylon-Working‘ and 
the ”Montauk Project"" were started using Nazi occultists and 
scientists to communicate with and materialize inter-
dimensional beings. They were the ”unofficial‘ pioneers of 
projects working on inter-dimensional time travel and 
eugenics/cloning.

Thus, with these projects, The Black Sciences were officially,
yet covertly born.

The Black Sciences are the ”Most Secret of all Secrets"" and are 
seriously guarded by special, screened soldiers, trained and 
born out of covert, Black Operations groups.

It is this elitist group‘s steadfast hope to merge the seen 
world with the unseen world. Their prioritized goal is 
currently designed to ensure that the world has a ”oneness-of 
mind"" (the hive concept), in addition to being spiritually 
harmonized to a designated frequency that will bring their plan 
into full activation. The ”Ascended Masters"" have commanded 
them to eliminate the Old World, with its old ideas,old way of 
thinking and all of its old people.

A new generation with a ”New World View"" is the agenda of the day.

That is why many conservatives, Christians, Jews, Muslims, 
Buddhists, etc. are on the surveillance and extermination 
lists. That is why more anti-Constitutional laws are becoming 
the ”New Law.""

That is why those - in the know -
from all religions and political ideologies are getting
extremely concerned and very nervous.

The ”Black Operations"" work for the ”Black Sciences""
who worship ”Black Occult Religions""
of the BROTHERHOOD OF THE BELL.

448,Encryption is No Longer an Option - Ways to Restore Your Natural Right to Privacy,"**Encryption is No Longer an Option**

“If the State’s going to move against you, it’s going to move against you.  Now, that doesn’t mean you need to be reckless of course.  I’m awful careful you guys, and even my degree of care and control ultimately won’t be enough if they get mad enough.  There will always be something…I’ve done what I hope is the best any man can do.  So…I hope when they finally do get me, it’s obvious that they just made it up.  I don’t go out of my way to make it easy.” – Cody Wilson

For all Anarchists our love for freedom unites us and guides us. I recently had a conversation with a mutual friend that Cody and I have in common and he stated something very insightful:

CryptoAnarchy is like the Lord of the Rings. You have to cooperate with people that you don’t know where they are or what they’re up to. That is, you just know that we are all figuring out at the same time on how to take down Sauron.

Anarchy is guided by the natural instinct for self-preservation. You can trust that others are also actively working in keeping us all free.

For us all to move into more synergistic cooperation we need more motivation. Nothing is more motivating than our movement away from an impending harmful evil. The persecution that Cody Wilson has gone through since he started his activism is testament to the evil that awaits the entire world if we do not fight against the impending digital global prison. Just note how easy it was to [find Cody.]( https://archive.fo/oGCim) *Government indoctrinated brownshirts and surveillance are everywhere.*

As Jeff recently said in London, “CryptoAnarchy is about the cryptography.” Cryptocurrency is only possible due to the privacy offered by cryptography. A true cryptocurrency is completely fungible, anonymous, and private. Blockchains without on-chain privacy set by default, are dangerous and offer nothing other than accurate surveillance.

That is, the moment you destroy a coin’s fungibility you corrupt its incentive structure. This is because you would then have two classes of the same coin within a transparent blockchain; these are coins that are “tainted” or “untainted” according to government. This differentiation created by blockchain surveillance leads “tainted” coins to be priced differently from “untainted” coins. Once this happens you destroy the functionality of a currency as a medium of exchange.

Imagine the headache of retailers in having to tell clients that they only accept “untainted” bitcoins. The result of not having a fungible medium of exchange is that you destroy the incentive structure of the network effect of a coin. You simply end up with a useless and unwanted network where value is supposed to be exchanged. If the units within the medium of exchange do not themselves contain the same value in the market, the utility of the network effect is destroyed.

The economic ramifications of non-fungible SurveillanceCoins are so bad that they make fiat currencies of central banks look good. In spite of their centralized proof of government violence, fiat currencies are more fungible and private than a coin based on a transparent blockchain.

For much time within crypto we would call the majority of blockchains as “pseudo-anonymous” because we knew the importance of fungibility. At that time blockchain analysis had not caught up to our technology. Now companies like [Elliptic]( https://www.elliptic.co/) and [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/) have made the vast majority of blockchains in the market transparent.

Sadly, most blockchain communities have not upgraded their privacy to be on chain by default- making them transparent. However, some more intelligent communities- like Monero- are at the same time growing because they understand the importance of fungibility.

Please understand that we at TDV are ahead of the pack in understanding where all of this is going. The vast majority of people won’t tell you these harsh truths about the Blockchain space, but it is our moral imperative to inform you as best as possible.

As time goes on, we will continue to champion actual fungible CryptoCurrencies and we will continue to make clear distinctions between a SurveillanceCoin and an actual CryptoCurrency.

It is important that we take a step back from CryptoCurrencies and focus on just cryptography. You can never be too careful. Throughout our groups we have had various requests as to how to better use different wallets.

Yes, we will cover all of that in our upcoming surprise for our community, but what is most important is that you protect yourself at the network layer, your identity, and your communication.

CryptoAnarchy began way before Bitcoin. If you want to know what will be happening to CryptoCurrencies and CryptoAnarchy in the near future, you need to read Timothy C. May’s 1992 prophetic [Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)

On reading this, you cannot afford to be idle regarding your privacy. This is not the time for you to easily give up what is most personal about you; your thoughts and identity. Your privacy is sacred. You need to protect your privacy as much as possible at all times. Don’t give into the defeatist notions of future technology being capable of deanonymizing any cryptography you currently use. Your goal is to be private right now in the present moment.

You are up against a global digital tyranny- [that is already here!](https://altcointoday.com/us-confiscates-millions-in-cryptocurrencies-in-alphabay-forfeiture-case/)

...Cazes was not a US citizen and the Alphabay servers and Cazes were not caught on US soil. Just because crimes involving narcotic deals took place in America, weirdly enough, the US seemingly has the right above anyone to seize Cazes’ property, and charge him and his accomplices in US trials...



**Use Secure Hardware That Protects You**

Be paranoid. Stay paranoid. The more paranoid you are the better. Currently the [five eyes are moving to strip away all of your privacy.](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018/access-evidence-encryption) They are on the direct path to force all companies to hand over back doors to software and hardware encryption.

This is a new breach on individual rights. The backdoors in hardware have existed since the 90’s via [Trusted Computing]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing) and [Digital Rights Management (DRM).]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) The difference is that now companies will be fined and
forced by governments [(all governments)]( https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/) to open up backdoors for the surveillance of all- in both software and hardware. **Australia is leading the charge since they are the only ones within the five eyes without a Bill of Rights.** 

If you really want to be secure, then you need to start with your hardware. Almost all laptops and hardware chips are engineered with unsafe software. These chips can transmit voice, your networking, pictures, and even video signals. Many of these chips are used to install spyware, malware and viruses.

The market has provided us with two easy plug-and-play hardware solutions.

[Purism]( https://puri.sm/) is a CryptoAnarchist company dedicated in offering us the safest computers in the market. Purism’s line of Librem Laptops is manufactured with software and hardware built from the ground up, where you can be at ease knowing there are no back doors built within it. They work with hardware component suppliers and the Free software community in making hardware that respects and protects your security. Every chip is
individually selected with emphasis on respecting freedom. (Purism Librem laptops have built in Kill-Switches for your microphone/camera and wireless/Bluetooth)

All of the necessary components that you would have to bundle up together- by yourself- from a community vetted place like [Prism-Break]( https://prism-break.org/en/all/) are already installed and ready to go within Librem laptops. Even if you were to install all of the necessary open-source encrypted alternatives, you still would not be able to 100% trust your current computer’s hardware.

Purism Librem laptops come with their own PureOS (operating system). Purism also offers compatibility with [Qubes OS]( https://www.qubes-os.org/) in a flash-drive (similar to [Tails]( https://tails.boum.org/)) to give you even another layer of protection on top of PureOS. Qubes OS is what [Edward Snowden uses.]( https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/781493632293605376)  PureOs is a derivative of [Debian GNU/Linux]( https://www.debian.org/). Qubes is free and open-source software (FOSS).

Purism is currently having a pre-sale for their first phone the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/).

Another popular safe hardware computer market alternative is [ORWL](https://orwl.org/). ORWL is a desktop PC. ORWL comes with a physical encryption key that looks like a keychain. If anyone ever tries to physically tamper with the ORWL computer, sensors will automatically detect the intrusion and erase everything. ORWL comes with the operating system options of Qubes OS, [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), or Windows.

ORWL does not receive payment for their products in Crypto. Purism on the other hand accepts payment in BitcoinCore, BitcoinCash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Decred, Dogecoin, and Monero.

ORWL is a good alternative for more computer savvy people. If you are not the most competent person with computers, Purism is the way to go. With Purism everything is ready to go.

Once you get good hardware don’t use this new computer for anything other than crypto stuff. That is, don’t use it with anything that requires your slave identity. Don’t access social media with your name, don’t access bank accounts, don’t access crypto exchanges, don’t access old email accounts, definitely don’t access anything that requires KYC and AML, and don’t access any identifying log-in that is related to any of your previous internet identities. Create new identities from scratch for this new computer.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU&amp;feature=youtu.be)  and learn about the basics on operational security (OPSEC). Take everything written here, and spoken at the conference in the video above, as barely the preliminary basic requirements of OPSEC. You should definitely continue your own research upon getting your new secure hardware computer.

(It would be best if you purchased this computer using crypto- Monero preferably- and have it mailed to a mailing address not associated with any of your addresses; think along the lines of [JJ Luna](https://www.survival-goods.com/v/RES/Invisible.pdf)).

**Encrypt your communication**

“This generation being born now... is the last free generation.You are born and either immediately or within say a year you are known globally. Your identity in one form or another –coming as a result of your idiotic parents plastering your name and photos all over Facebook or as a result of insurance applications or passport applications– is known to all major world powers.” – [Julian Assange]( https://www.rt.com/news/438968-assange-last-interview-blackout/)

The vast majority of our community uses Facebook. Unfortunately its network effect is something we all rely on to some degree. Fortunately for us a friend of our community created FaceMask. Through FaceMask we can still use Facebook in complete privacy- away from Zuckerberg's prying eyes. In the near future we will implement FaceMask into our TDV groups as optional privacy for our posts. We will provide our subscribers with the keys necessary to encrypt and decrypt the messages and posts. Again, this is optional. For now please go to the link above and familiarize yourself with Facemask and its technology.

Don’t use Google. If you are using Google start transitioning out of it. If you are using Gmail, start moving towards encrypted services like [ProtonMail]( https://protonmail.com/) or [TutaNota.](https://tutanota.com/) They both offer a free option, try them both out and choose your favorite.
Use two factor authentication on everything that requires you to log-in that allows for the use of two factor authentication. Most people use Google Authenticator and [Authy.](https://authy.com/) I personally prefer the open source options of [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) &amp; [andOTP.](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP) Use the one that you find best suited for you. Using one is paramount for security nowadays.

If you are one that uses Google Docs with your team, move instead to [CryptPad.]( https://cryptpad.fr/) The more you use CryptPad the more addicting it becomes; your collaborated work is encrypted and private. You no longer will have to worry about knowing that Google is capturing all of your collaborated work. You can also start using CryptPad for free.

If you are using Skype for conference calls, switch to [Jitsi.](https://jitsi.org/) Jitsi is even easier to use than Skype. If you use their [MeetJitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) feature you can just access the encrypted conferencing via any browser by agreeing with your other party on the same predetermined passphrase. 

Don’t use regular text messaging. Rather, use [Signal](https://signal.org/), [Wickr](https://wickr.com/), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), or [Telegram.](https://telegram.org/)

**Use a VPN**
A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts all of your traffic via a private network of servers scattered throughout the world. This process anonymizes your IP address. Make sure you don’t use your identity when using a VPN- that would just give away your identity as being connected with the VPN servers you are using.

Many VPN providers register your activity and can hand it over to government if they so demand it. They break their promises to their clients all the time. Let’s minimize risk by staying away from the most draconian of jurisdictions.

To lessen this issue, do not ever use a VPN that is based out of any of the [5 eyes:](https://everipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement#Global_coverage)

-United Kingdom

-United States

-Australia

-Canada

-New Zealand

Furthermore, avoid VPNs based out of the following nine countries, that combined with the first 5 make up
the [14 eyes](https://thebestvpn.com/5-9-14-eyes-countries/):

-Denmark 

-France

-The Netherlands

-Norway

-Germany

-Belgium

-Italy

-Spain

-Sweden


No VPN is a complete safeguard. In spite of this, it is still best to use one. We recommend you ONLY use it (turn it on) when doing crypto-related things and only crypto-related things on your regular computer. For your new encrypted hardware computer have it on at all times. If you use it to access an actual bank account, or another personal account (including crypto accounts that require your personal information; read coinbase, or any other exchange) — then, again, the use of the VPN use becomes trite.

Here are six VPN options outside of the 14 eyes that we recommend you research further and use at your own discretion:

[NordVPN](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/nordvpn/) (Panama)

[CyberGhost](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/cyberghost/) (Romania)

[HideMe](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/hide-me/) (Malaysia)

[Astrill](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/astrill/) (Seychelles)

[TrustZone](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/trust-zone/) (Seychelles)

[iVPN](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/ivpn/) (Gibralter)

Like all things in the market now, some VPNs take Crypto as payment—others do not. It is best if you bought your VPN with crypto not not your credit card, debit card, or paypal.

[TOR](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) **(The Onion Router)**


The Onion Router is software that you use as a browser. It protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network- throughout the world- of relays runned by volunteers. This prevents evesdroppers from learning your IP address, spying on you, and disclosing your physical location. TOR also allows you to access sites that are blocked.

You can use TOR and a VPN simultaneously. If you are new to all of this, it is best that you just learn how to use the features of your new computer coupled with your preferred VPN. The use of TOR is a little more complicated and you will have to configure it according the specifications of your preferred VPN. As you begin this process, as long as you are using your VPN correctly you should be fine.

**Fincen and crypto-exchanges**

[ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io/#/coins) is now stuck having to [require its users to deanonymize their transactions]( https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/shapeshift-will-now-require-basic-personal-details-new-membership-program/) in order to meet KYC and AML requirements; it pretty clear that they got ShapeShift under the [Bank Secrecy Act](https://searchfinancialsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Bank-Secrecy-Act-BSA). Stay away from Shapeshift [(sorry @erikvorhees)](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees).

“Very disappointed that @ShapeShift_io is implementing KYC. Just goes to show that any centralized entity will be pushed in that direction, which is why LN, atomic swaps and Decentralized Exchanges are the only way to resist a surveillance economics.” -  Andreas Antonopoulos 

As the news of ShapeShift broke out, the market was [quick to answer]( https://medium.com/@account_94523/kyc-the-scourge-of-the-industry-or-the-sacrifice-for-salvation-cb81a4d6fc5f) with alternatives. Among the private centric alternatives to ShapeShift we find [Godex](https://godex.io/), [ChangeHero](https://changehero.io/), [XMR.TO](https://xmr.to/), and [Bisq](https://bisq.network/).

ChangeHero and Godex are pretty much the same business concept as ShapeShift. The only difference is that they do not require you to become transparent. XMR.TO allows you to make BTC payments by using Monero.

That is, by using Monero together with XMR.TO you can pay any BTC address in the world while protecting your privacy.

**Bisq is the Best Option**

The most important to focus on is Bisq. Bisq is a complete decentralized exchange. Bisq is instantly accessible- there is no need for registration or approval from a central authority. The system is decentralized peer-to-peer and trading cannot be stopped or censored.

Bisq is safe. Unlike MtGox and the rest of centralized exchanges, Bisq never holds your funds. Bisq provides a system of decentralized arbitration with security deposits that protect traders. The privacy is set where no one except trading partners exchange personal identifying information. All personal data is stored locally.

All communication on Bisq is end-to-end encrypted routed over Tor. Upon downloading and running Bisq TOR runs on Bisq automatically. Every aspect of the development of Bisq is [open source](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq).

Bisq is easy to use. If you are accustomed to centralized exchanges, you might find Bisq a little different. If you want anonymity and privacy, this is the best crypto exchange we have. Tell your friends about Bisq. Just download Bisq and take it for a test drive, you will feel fresh freedom of entering into peaceful voluntary exchange with your fellow man. Do it, it’s good for the soul.

**On Cody**

I would like to personally thank all of our subscribers for generously donating to [Defense Distributed](https://defcad.com/donate/) on our last issue. At the moment of us putting out our last newsletter, DefDist had raised less than 100k USD. After our Newsletter got out, his donations went past 300k USD.

Thank you very much for helping out our friends in their continual fight for freedom!

Please pray for Cody, his friends, and his family.

I once asked Cody what his background was- because idk his mannerisms have always been interesting to me. He answered; “I am Romani- I am a Gypsy.”

Thank you for helping out our Gypsy friend and his band of rebels! They will very much be using your generous donations now that things got much more serious.

If you haven’t donated, please [consider donating.](https://defcad.com/donate/) Blessings!

456,Charles Darwin And The Spotted Alien Theory,"Imagine you're a space-faring scientist and you land on a planet that looks just like Earth. You cleverly conceal your ship after landing and begin your business of meeting the planet's inhabitants and helping them in any way that you possibly can. Before long, you run into someone that looks just like us, except they have spots. If we were on Earth, you might say they have full-blown psoriasis, but we're not, so you don't. You just record in the ship's log what they look like, and since you can't communicate with them, you assume you are looking at normal, healthy alien skin.

Since you're a scientist and all, you set about learning as much as you can about the biology of these beings because well, that's just what you do. Plus, you’re already here. How long would it take you to discover the subject you were studying is not healthy? You have no idea what their skin temperature should be, and you can only see shades of grey, so as far as you're concerned, the being simply has spots.

But what if the entire population of the planet had spots? Once your machine deciphers their languages, it begins talking to different people on your behalf and you discover that yes, it's perfectly normal for people to have skin like that in this part of the solar system. They blame the sun and that's all anybody will say about it.

You decide to look deeper, since you're a scientist and all, plus you're already here. You start by researching other species of animals on this planet, by observing how the sun affects them, and before long you realize that those spots on all your new friends can't possibly be considered healthy, no matter how you look at it. 

You present your scientific findings to the imaginary-planet-equivalent of the UN, and they thank you profusely, then on the way back to your spaceship after the meeting, a hellfire missile destroys your taxi and the surrounding six city blocks.

Back on your home world, they erect a monument in your honor, before launching the tactical response teams.

---

Would alien visitors to Earth be able to tell whether or not humanity was being manipulated by an outside force? Of course they would, but how would they respond to such a discovery? They would either try to help us escape it, or they would take advantage of the situation. Let’s face it – we’re not expecting go-go dancers from Venus or little green men from Mars anymore – we’re on the look-out for super-intelligent, interstellar travelers. If there actually are beings out there who can collapse the space between stars, they won’t have any more trouble recognizing the difference between sickness and health than the difference between right and wrong. Between day and night. Between good and evil, or between the sun and moon.

Since we don’t have anything to compare it to, all we can say about the moon is that “it is what it is” – which isn’t saying very much at all. It’s not alive like the Earth, and it’s not on fire like the sun – it’s something else altogether, and that makes it really hard to see. It is The Shadow, it is The Darkness, and it appears to be exactly the same size as the sun when viewed from Earth, which gives it the appearance an exact copy, and copies are something the ancient Gnostics clearly warned us about.

It’s important to limit our consideration of celestial objects to the ones that matter most. The sun literally creates matter when it grows a seed weighing only a few milligrams into a thousand-ton-tree. There may be stars and planets out there that have a physical influence on the Earth and its inhabitants, but none of them contribute to real-world matters as forcefully as the sun and moon.

Earth travels around the sun because that’s where all our energy comes from. All life requires energy, and Earth is definitely alive. We could say the sun is alive too, or we could say it’s the source of life which are both pretty much saying the same thing. If we’re going to really try to understand the world around us, we need to begin by considering its most fundamental parts. The relationship between the Earth and sun is a natural starting point. Plato thought so, too. He clearly equated the sun with goodness.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Good

Sure, it can burn you to death if you’re not careful, but that’s only because too much of a good thing negates its objective goodness. Our skin doesn’t burn because the sun changes, it burns because our activity changes. The sun remains good no matter what we do. All plant and animal life depends on it, even those who live in the dark, for they consume other life which relies on the light of the sun.

Space-travelling aliens would know this. But, what could we expect them to know about the moon? 

We’ve been taught that moons are very common and that they always face the host planet perpetually because of tidal forces on planets that don’t even have any oceans - never mind any fucking tides. We believe that Mars’ ‘moons’ are pretty much the same thing as Earth’s moon even though Mars’ ‘moons’ are only 12 miles across on average while ours is over 2,000 miles across. (I can’t even make an effective graphic to scale with all five objects because although Mars isn’t much smaller than Earth, Phobos and Deimos are so tiny that they’re invisible.) 

Failure to distinguish the difference between the ‘moons of Mars’ and the scourge of Earth is just like ignoring the difference between a kayak so far away that we can barely see it, and a battleship anchored right fucking here. 

Astronomers have been selling Mars'Mini-Moons ever since the late nineteenth century, and greater men than us have gobbled them up thinking they were getting a legitimate moon for the money. Charles Darwin was one of these purposely misguided souls. He wrote something along the lines of “Well now. Since astronomers have discovered moons orbiting Mars, just like ours, it’s safe to assume that having a moon or moons is well, just another part of nature's grand scheme. Metaphorically speaking, our moon is clearly the third part of ‘the holy trinity’, and therefore they must be common to all live (and formerly living) planets, regardless of where they are found.""

**“There is  no free speech in \[the\] real  world and you will be suppressed  for     telling the truth that is not supported by the system.” — Nasim   Aghdam**

After  another round of Twitter purges by the techno-Stasi, I felt a very   real  sense of loss   that I could not quite articulate.  Several of my   closest  Twitter   friends – two of whom had more than ten  thousand   followers –  were   gone in an instant. Ever-changing and exceedingly   nebulous “[rules](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6070323/Twitter-continues-cull-users-bid-clean-platform.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline)”    are enforced by Twitter to get rid of what they deem to be   “low-quality” users – so low-quality that I know for a fact many of them  had been seeing well over a hundred thousand monthly profile visits     and  ten million monthly impressions.

**By      “low-quality,” what Twitter and other social media platforms mean    is    anything that runs contrary to the mainstream narrative and to   their    political machinations.**

# Low-quality is clearly a euphemism for what the  Soviets might have deemed “counter-revolutionary”

\-Under      Article 58: those refusing to toe the Party line, the dissidents      dealing information on the black market throughout the Eastern bloc,  the     brave souls  risking everything to speak truth to power.

**What      social media platforms are doing when they delete accounts is far    more   wicked than merely controlling the flow of information and     viewpoints   in the new** ***de facto*** **public square. They are dealing  devastating psychological blows to those who are silenced, as well as  their followers.**      Many of the men and women on social media –  particularly those      sympathetic to our metapolitical convictions – have  nowhere else to go      where they can be with like-minded people, and no other place to to    run   where they can escape the nihilism, despair, and  insanity of  our     political hegemony (to paraphrase Kipling, those who  hear the  same     things they hear and see the same things they see).[\[1\]](https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn1) For      many, their online friends and the ability to speak their minds and      share observations on social media are the only reprieve they have   from    this postmodern nightmare from which we cannot seem to wake,  and  it    provides a very real support network for those who often have   nobody in    their day-to-day lives with whom they can speak freely   about the   current  cultural malaise.

Deleting     accounts and  thus severing these support networks can – and often   does –   forcibly  isolate the censored individual from the only people   they   know who truly  understand them.  All of these relationships   (many built   over years),  all of the ingenious intellectual material,   all of the   private  conversations that are left unfinished, are all   suddenly  gone   “like  tears in rain.” All of the posts that gave hope   when there  was   none,  all of those confidants, all of those random   memes that  granted   the  only smirk that was had all week – all vanish   without a  trace  into  the  digital ether.

# Ostracism has long been used as a form of social control and punishment.

The      ancient Greeks would cast out those members of society who were    deemed  a  threat to the city for ten years, cutting them off from their     families,  friends, and familiar surroundings. [Contemporary social psychological research](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110510WilliamsOstracism.html) on ostracism proves that **even      slight exclusion, including by strangers, lowers a person’s      self-esteem, mood, and their sense of self-worth, control, and      belonging. Upon being excluded from a group, the same part of the brain      that registers physical pain is activated** – although    studies    also show that the pain of social exclusion lasts even longer    than    physical pain, leading to increased levels of aggression,   lower     productivity and mood, feelings of despair and helplessness,   and even    suicidal ideation.[\[2\]](https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn2)

There      is also the psychological warfare being carried out against those     users  whose accounts are not outright deleted, but rather     “shadowbanned.”  Twitter has claimed in a company [blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html)that   they do not shadowban – although a few lines later, they admit  to     ranking content from “bad-faith actors” lower than others. And of       course, a “bad-faith actor” is merely whoever Twitter, Facebook,       YouTube, or the [Anti-Defamation League](https://www.cnet.com/news/adl-anti-defamation-league-facebook-twitter-google-hate-speech/)  deem them to be.

This      is nothing short of gaslighting – given that they are not notified,     all  they can see is the drop in their interactions, giving the     impression  that your messages are no longer being well-received and     that you are  essentially alone, talking to  yourself, causing some to     eventually tire  of trying altogether.

# Social media has a history of psychologically manipulating its users.

In January 2012, Facebook conducted what has been widely regarded as a [highly unethical experiment](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-facebooks-user-20140630-column.html)involving   nearly seven hundred thousand unknowing Facebook users. The       experiment divided participants (who were not informed that they  were    in  one) into control and experimental groups. Those subjected to  the      experiment had either positive or negative emotive posts removed   from     their news feeds. Results show that when negative posts were    withheld   from users/participants, they themselves used fewer    emotionally negative   words and began using more positive ones.    Conversely, when positive    posts were withheld from users, they then    used fewer positive emotional    words and began using more negative    ones. **By   manipulating what a person    sees on their social media account,  Facebook  was able to alter the    content the users themselves then  produced**.[\[3\]](https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/09/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare/#_ftn3)

The      results were remarkable, researchers found emotional suggestion can      very much happen via online social networks, and social media   companies    can and will intentionally manipulate the mood of their   users. The    connection between mood and emotional well-being to   psychological and    physical health and well-being are   well-established. This knowledge    could be used for everything from   lowering consumers’ moods in order to    encourage impulse buying    (anxiety and depression are known causes of    it) to being used to push    people who are already unstable over the    edge. I would not put   anything  past these people.

There is also those remaining on social media, being gaslit by the absence of those who share their sentiments, to consider. **When      all they  see on their newsfeeds are those sanitized views that     remain,  they begin to think that they are the only “crazy” ones who     have such  ideas**.

**Twitter,      the Anti-Defamation League, and others are indeed influencing the      political discourse, unilaterally deciding what ideas can be be      discussed and which can’t. Even more insidiously, they are waging a      total war on the hearts and minds of their users. They are separating      people – often vulnerable ones – from their support networks,  with      devastating consequences for some.**

490,QAnon is US Military Intelligence that recruited Trump for President to prevent Coup D’etat?,"# I'm not saying that this IS the TRUTH. But I felt it is worth for all to read - &amp; trust yourself!

 According to veteran investigative reporter and [best selling author](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Deep-State-Fight-President-ebook/dp/B07981FQ35/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523557514&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=killing+the+deep+state),  Dr. Jerome Corsi, he was approached three years ago by a group of  generals and told that Donald Trump had been recruited by U.S. military  intelligence to run in the 2016 Presidential elections, and subsequently  help remove corrupt Deep State officials from positions of power. Corsi  claims that QAnon represents the same group of senior military  intelligence officials who are exposing the Deep State corruption and  officials involved in a history of treasonous actions against the U.S.  Republic.

This is what [Corsi said](https://youtu.be/9O8VPOd3Dsw?t=6m30s) at a meeting on April 11, 

About  three years ago a group of Generals came to me, and it was explained to me that they were ready to conduct a coup d’etat. They were ready to  move Barack Obama from office with military force. And then a few weeks  later I got another call and said they were reconsidering.

You  know why they were reconsidering? \[audience calls out answers\] Because  they talked to Donald Trump, and Trump had agreed he would run, and they  agreed that if he would run, they would conduct their coup d’etat as a  legitimate process, rooting out the traitors within government.  And  that pact between the military and Donald Trump has held, as we have  been interpreting and watching, and *\[many people\]* has been following ***Q.***

 QAnon  is military intelligence and close to Trump, and the intelligence we’ve  getting, that we’ve explained on Infowars, really is a lot of the  inside script. While Corsi  didn’t name the generals or provide hard evidence for his startling  claim, an examination of public comments by President Trump, QAnon and  related political events do make Corsi’s extraordinary claim very  plausible. It’s  important to note that Corsi’s speech happened only a day after a tweet  by President Trump featuring him with 20 senior U.S. military officials  who dined with him the previous night:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 2h9h2w3tv2o11...*

 Only hours after Trump’s tweet, Q posted a message commenting about the photo’s significance:

 

https://i.redd.it/7lsldtczv2o11.jpg

#   

In the photo,  the man next to Vice President Pence and Trump is Admiral Michael Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency. It was Rogers who  travelled to Trump Tower on November 17, 2016, a week after the  Presidential election, without the knowledge of his superiors in the  Obama administration.

The next day, the [*Washington Post ran a story*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-and-intelligence-community-chiefs-have-urged-obama-to-remove-the-head-of-the-nsa/2016/11/19/44de6ea6-adff-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?utm_term=.b82f16d866de) saying that senior Defense and Intelligence officials in the Obama administration were aghast at Roger’s action:

In a move apparently unprecedented for a military officer, Rogers, without  notifying superiors, traveled to New York to meet with Trump on  Thursday at Trump Tower. That caused consternation at senior levels of  the administration, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.

The *Washington Post*  went on to report that a recommendation had been previously made to  President Obama to remove Rogers in October 2016 by James Clapper  (Director of National Intelligence) and Ashton Carter (Secretary of  Defense). This coincided with a FISA court approving a request made by  President Obama for his administration to spy on Trump’s campaign.

Given recent disclosures about FISA court orders approving the Obama administration  spying on Trump, the timing suggests that Rogers had travelled to New  York to warn Trump that the intelligence community were spying on him  under the authority of a FISA court order. This is how [one analyst explained](http://anamericancomment.blogspot.com/2017/03/did-nsa-admiral-mike-rogers-warn-trump.html) the sequence of events:

NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers didn’t want to participate in the spying  scheme (Clapper, Brennan, Etc.), which was the baseline for President Obama’s post presidency efforts to undermine Donald Trump and keep Trump from digging into the Obama labyrinth underlying his remaining  loyalists.  After the October spying operation went into effect, Rogers  unknown loyalty was a risk to the Obama objective. 10 Days after the  election Rogers travels to President-Elect Trump without notifying those who were involved in the intel scheme.   
 

It would be  fair to conclude that QAnon is acting with the approval or support of  Admiral Rogers, and that intelligence data is being anonymously leaked  to expose the extent of Deep State corruption.

Another interesting aspect of the photo tweeted by Trump showing him, Pence and  Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, flanked by 20 uniformed military  officers, is that 9 were on his right, and 11 on his left. Was this  symbolism for the 911 event that is regarded by Corsi, Jones and many in  the US Patriot community as a false flag event, orchestrated by corrupt Deep State officials that had manipulated both the Bush (43) and Obama  administrations?

It’s worth  examining Corsi’s claim that a group of generals were prepared to launch  a military coup given the level of Deep State corruption and control  prior to Trump choosing to run. Could this have been possible?

According to a [November 2, 2017 post by Q](https://qanonposts.com/?q=military%20intelligence), if Hillary Clinton had won the election or results were overturned in her favor, a military coup would indeed have occurred given her level of  corruption: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hvvpsktnw2o11.jpg

 

As mentioned in a [previous article](https://www.exopolitics.org/bombshell-qanon-posts-link-clintons-cia-to-jfk-jr-plane-crash/), the Clintons’ corruption began with Bill’s term as Governor of the State of Arkansas, where he supported CIA drug running operations out of  Mena, Arkansas. As investigative reporter Roger Morris discovered, there were many documents showing how the Clintons financially benefited, and even photos showing Bill using cocaine. This made it easy  for the Deep State to manipulate Bill Clinton throughout his  Presidency.

As Bill’s Presidency was coming to an end, Hillary’s rise to high political office was made possible, [according to Q](https://www.exopolitics.org/bombshell-qanon-posts-link-clintons-cia-to-jfk-jr-plane-crash/), by the CIA assassinating John F. Kennedy’s Jr., who was a threat to her plan to run for New York’s open US Senate seat in the November 2000  election. 

https://i.redd.it/bzl2jk7zw2o11.jpg

If Clinton had indeed been helped in this sinister way by the Deep State, it is easy to understand how important she was to their future plans, and how deeply compromised she was.

These are only some of the “corrupt and dirty” events mentioned by Q, which the Clintons were deeply involved in, all of which facilitated Deep  State power. As to Corsi’s claim that military intelligence had recruited Trump to run and thereby  prevent a Clinton victory through a rigged election, here is what Q had to say on the topic back on October 31, 2017:

https://i.redd.it/oclxusgex2o11.jpg

Corsi did not elaborate on the three generals that approached him in 2015, but it would be a fair to guess that Lt. General Michael Flynn was involved. As a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn would have been aware of the deep corruption underscoring the Clintons and the dirty tricks played by the CIA in support of the Deep State.

Flynn famously led chants of “lock her up” at the 2016 Republican convention when discussing Hillary Clinton. [https://youtu.be/tx94428MYcc](https://youtu.be/tx94428MYcc)

Flynn’s appointment as Trump’s National Security Advisor, and quick departure less than a month later, appears to have been a major setback for the Military Intelligence community secretly backing the Trump administration. On October 28, 2017, Q first began releasing information on message boards. Presumably, this was done to enlist public support in exposing and taking action against corrupt public officials impeding Trump’s policies and the Military Intelligence community’s plans.

The level of information on Deep State control and corruption released by Q in over [2273 posts to date](https://qmap.pub/) is astounding in its scope and impact. A number of false flag events  have been revealed, the most significant being a January 13, 2018 [nuclear ballistic missile attack](https://www.exopolitics.org/qanon-corroborates-hawaii-missile-attack-hunt-for-rogue-cia-submarine/) against Hawaii, which was intended to start a major regional war.

The knowledge  that these revelations are coming from senior military intelligence officials working closely with the Trump Administration to overcome the corrupting power and influence of the Deep State is highly significant.

Exposing and removing corrupt Deep State officials will open the door to many life changing technologies that have been suppressed for decades, to finally be released to the public. It appears that this is what Trump was referring to during his [Inauguration speech](https://www.exopolitics.org/trump-inauguration-speech-hints-at-official-disclosure-of-secret-space-programs/) on January 20, 2017:

We  stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries  of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness  the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

These technologies are so advanced that a Star Trek-like future is well within the reach of all of us. This merits keeping, at the very least, an open mind about the Trump administration, what Corsi was told about a possible coup d’etat and the 2016 election, and what Q is revealing  to us.  *© Michael E.

491,(1040). Typical elimination plan in 2005,"(1040). Typical elimination plan in 2005 (9/23/2018)

In Hurricane Katrina event, the Feds planed to eliminate me, my wife and my siblings.
 
(1) 9/10 to 9/17, My brother and two of my sisters were arranged a trip in East Coast.  At same time Hurricane Ophelia went along East coast, ready to raid the land any time. Watch the odd path of Ophelia. This was chart on 9/14, it never landed since the case was soured.  

[img]https://www.weather.gov/images/mhx/20050914/opheliatrack.jpg[/img]

(2) I was intimidated by the Home Owner Association to clean the yard in September. Just then San Jose City offered a free dumping on 9/24. It was a typical framing case of planting illegal trace in garbage. 

9/24 was the landing date of Hurricane Rita. Media once predicted it would be bigger than Katrina. If the Feds had framed me in dumping case, then Rita would have played a big disaster to distract. 

(3) 9/22 to 9/29, My wife was arranged a South-east Asia trip. She almost encountered a Typhoon on 9/27. 


Reference:

(361). Storm is now a killing tool of Feds (11/27/05)

Back to 9/24 framed case. In ""#342. Homeowner Association again (9/12/05)"" I talked about How Feds arranged a trip for my wife between 9/22 to 9/29 so they could frame me in a special ""9/24 Neighborhood Cleanup day"". Then what would happen to my wife while she was in South east Asia? 

They prepared a trip accident. 

My wife told me a lucky story when she returned. The travel group would tour Haloon Bay in Vietnam on 9/27. Some big boss in the group gave up the tour with the excuse they must attend a meeting or just plainly said they were afraid of the typhoon. Only a few tourists went with my wife. But the typhoon miraculously left the Haloon Bay a day before so they had a nice boat tour. 

On 9/30/05, there was a picture in Mercury News which shows a woman walking through rubble caused by Typhoon Damrey. ""The worst storm to hit Vietnam in a decade. Officials said Thursday they had recovered 38 bodies so far.""

I think there would be a ""boat accident caused by typhoon"" on 9/27 if  the 9/24 framed case went on successfully. The good luck for my wife was not a nice trip but a safe one.

We've seen lie after lie. For instance, this morning that felonies aren't crimes tweeted by Trump. 

We've seen taxes cut for Power while the people suffer with increased health care costs, trade policy that is costing jobs and more money, and now the potential for federal benefits to be cut to pay for Power's tax cuts. We've seen net neutrality politicized and dismantled.

The second top comment is where it gets interesting. 

&gt; I feel as if this sentiment is fundamentally wrong. Orwell was wrong and the signs are obvious. **This censorship is not at all governmental, rather it is self imposed- by the people, for the people.** In truth, Huxley best predicted our current trajectory. He envisioned a world controlled by primality and censored according to what brought the least amount of discomfort. That is our current path, not authoritarian regimes forcibly controlling and contriving public opinion. 

This is a heavy user of r/politics, which has become an anti-Trump DNC party circlejerk sub. So this is probably a good snap shot of how they are justifying this censorship to each other.

Corporations censoring political perspectives at the behest of political groups funded by billionaires is actually self imposed by the people. The mental gymnastics. But I bet you many have fallen for this justification.     ",conspiracy,1534955288,yellowsnow2,13,4,True,2018-08-22

First Michael Flynn confesses to committing a felony by lying to the FBI, even though he didn't, just to protect the president from a phony witch hunt of an investigation.

Now Michael Cohen confesses to eight felonies, even though they aren't crimes, and he didn't do anything wrong, just to protect the president from a phony scandal involving payments to a porn star who the president never had an affair with, but just decided to give money to anyway.

And it's all fine because it has nothing to do with Russia, which is all phony.

24,"Death of an ideal, Murder of the Rand","So this is a great conspiracy theory (hopefully only that) that I saw yesterday.

This is basically a repost of u/Moppy771 that was posted on r/southafrica last night and summarily deleted by the mods, although it seemed to be because of the inflammatory title (""Why the ANC rapes the Rand"", the ANC is our current ruling party) rather than the content.

This is an abridged edit of what was posted, as OP named some very powerful names that he apparently had proof for. I however, don't have that proof, so I am redacting the names, as I do not have the same proof and as a South African I could be liable for libel.

&gt;​ So I was tipped off to this by someone who is in a position closely observe forex trades. The theory is that the vast majority of all top-level politics in SA is effectively controlled by a small (or maybe not so small) group of financial and political elites, hell, maybe even more than one group, who control and orchestrate events that are leading our country the way it is headed with the sole purpose of raking in money.  
&gt;  
&gt;The TL;DR of forex trading is that being able to predict a currency is the world’s quickest route to having more money than you could ever spend. The day to day shifts are too jumpy, and the long term shifts too slow to make a profit on for the most part, but say for instance you had a reliable method to significantly crash your currency for a few days, well then you would have an easy path to making free money.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you were the sort of person to have a forex trader on hand, it would be simple enough to make a deal for an option on forex at a rate on par to current exchange rates, for a week from now. Simply speaking, if the rand stays on par or becomes stronger than the dollar in that week, you just lost the money you paid to reserve that option, but if you were to get lucky enough for the rand to drop in value, then you just bought a million dollars for 15% below the exchange rate. I'm sure you can see how this scales with the investment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The only thing now stopping you from literally buying free money is the rand not dropping in value. If only there was a convenient way to do that, such as paying off some public political figure to do something stupid such as firing a gun at a rally and threatening civil war, or having the president refuse to step down publicly, or announce that they are going to amend the constitution to allow them to crash the economy (this is assuming that said politicians aren't directly in on it, which is likely).  
&gt;  
&gt;I have seen a lead trader that dealt with forex who would get a ton of instructions to get massive options (hundreds of millions of rand or more at a time) all at once, targeting a specific period. Then lo and behold, two days later there would be world news of students getting tear gassed or imminent civil war, and the rand would drop like a stone, and a couple dozen people just became tens of millions of rands richer, overnight, without lifting a finger. now imagine this repeated by hundreds of elite around the country, dozens of times a year, and including the inevitable almost-return-to-norm, and a million rand at the start of the year, with the very low assumption of 5 percent made on each intentional dip and subsequent rise, and you would have more than tripled your money by the end of the year. In fact this trader made millions just on commissions in each period, and there are dozens of traders in the same position as him.  
&gt;  
&gt;So there you have it, the plan is to crash this country with no survivors because a few hundred people with no morals and enough cash and/or power to control the country and media want to make some quick cash at the expense of us unfortunates that have to use the currency and live in our country. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this has been going on since the 70s or 80s, given trends and given the suspicious financial history of many of our country’s richest and most powerful. I think that's all.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh and this isn't just some crazy coincidence conspiracy theory I whipped up based on a few observations, almost every bank and major politician, the whole of the ... 

this is where the names are redacted. I can mention the Zumas (the family of our ex-president who stepped down in a scandal) as some of them have actually been caught out at what is alluded to, and ""major banks"" as no corporations are actually named. I have a good idea of the ""major politicians"" too but redacted for the same reason as the business-people named.

&gt;...are all confirmed involved heavily in forex, and lots of them have already been busted for various forex-based and other schemes and collusions. There are others I strongly believe to be involved, but I chose not to name them in this post as the family names would be easier to use to identify the individuals, and they do not often appear in newspapers like those I have already mentioned, as I do not have proof of their involvement other than seeing them make profits off of exceedingly well-timed and counter-intuitive trade orders that luckily for them turned out to be right.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is a very good and frighteningly probably theory. In the past year alone I can think of a dozen events that impacted the rand heavily that could have been easily avoided or were alluded to be intentional even at the time. Banks get fined for currency fixing all the time, so this is hardly an unheard of scheme, just one that runs much higher profit margins. 

As a South African, it is pretty shit to think that our country could be heading the way of Zimbabwe as a side effect of some rich and powerful intentionally screwing the country over to become even richer and more powerful.

I've noticed that all of the TV show genres seem to share a common theme.
All of the ideas that get greenlit for remake after remake
(Law shows, doctor shows, investigator shows) which all get 8 seasons and 2 spinoffs.
They are all about integral offical ""systems"" that we rely on, and when you study them, those systems, like the justice system, essentially relies upon people's belief in them to continue.  Brief evidence bullet points for this are
- Lots of people locked up, basis for a lot of those convictions was DNA evidence, well turns out that's not a reliable or accurate means of determining guilt and it's being challened more and more by attorneys.
-Medical industries hawk a lot of experimental and toxic treatments and proceedures and charge 10x (100x in NA) what they're worth, good advice from doctors is scarce.
-Police undergo psychological evaluation, this should be good news, but they actually select for psychopathy and narcisissm. This is to be sure that they will react with violence when their authority is questioned.

We chalk it up to just being TV, of course the stories are succinct and wrap up nicely.
But what if they portray all of the systems chugging along nicely, (criminal gets caught, glorifying the law enforcement and investigation process) (she solves the case using a pair of the victem's sunglasses, glorifying psudoscience like fingerprints or dna evidence)
(They fail to save the patients but the doctor gave it 100% but the diagnosis came too late, glorifying the trial and error body of information that we strap on medical students and expect them to be able to apply it, if it's even good knowledge ((i've heard people say that about 5 years into your career as a doc, 50% of your training is obsolete)))

89,USS Liberty Truths,"Super oversimplified explanation:

So USS Liberty was a recon asset of the US.  It sits off the coast of Cyrus illegally spying on Israel and receiving all radio intel (Israel isn't a very big place).  Info is passed to Arab nations to keep Big Oil happy among a lot of other less than scrupulous alliances.   This is during an active war, so Israel can't play games.  It can't just call it off, as then the ""world"" will know about US actively undermining its ally, so Israel has no choice but to do a first sweep and destroy the radio equipment which is mostly external.  There is one section of the hull that has most data storage that need to be destroyed, as this info will cost tens of thousands of lives when it is shared with Egypt and Jordan etc.   So the Israelis reluctantly have to choose a pilot to attack an American vessel.  Nobody wants to do it naturally, but to save many more lives some American born pilot chooses to do it.  

Obviously Israel could have completely sunk the ship and killed everyone if they actually had a desire to, and they didn't.  There was collateral damage obviously, and they had to play it off in the media as an accident and have Israel pay for the damage and families etc.   A much longer and more thorough version is written in ""America's Secret War Against the Jews""...yeah I'm sure many people on r/conspiracy will get a kick out of that and just laugh it off, but hey, if you don't want to know the TRUTH, then don't look at both sides of a story.

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer to get to the truth even if it involves digging.  Just reading reddit posts is ignorant at this point.

113,Columbine: Conspiracy?,"The [message board] (https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/index.php) *Echoes of Columbine* has been active since 2003. 

It was founded to study a number of disturbing questions surrounding the massacre of Columbine High School. It has expanded to provide a deep political analysis of school shootings and the larger rampage murder phenomena.

**OTHER SUSPECTS**

--Why did 100+ witnesses report seeing more than two gunmen or assailants (including an adult) who did not resemble Harris nor Klebold? Why was no action taken when 40+ witnesses identified the other assailants by name? Why were these other assailants - associates of the suspects who had histories of violence, hatred for their peers and sketchy alibis - allowed to walk? 

-Why did at least 35 witnesses report hearing gunfire or explosions after 12 PM when Harris and Klebold were alleged to have killed themselves? According to the *Denver Post* (4-21-99): ""By 3:45 p.m., shots still rang out inside the school.""

--Why did so many witnesses recall hearing gunfire and explosions simultaneously or near-simultaneously when the suspects were officially together for almost the entirety of the attack?

--Why did a number of students recall hearing fully automatic gunfire when no automatics were officially used? How would the suspects have obtained fully automatic weapons?

--Why does the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office indicate that the suspects never went to science rooms 1 and 8 when numerous shell casings were discovered in this area? 

--Why does the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office include no mention of one suspect's brief exit on the east side of the school (as reported by multiple witnesses)?

--If the suspect on the roof was in fact an innocent repairman, why did witnesses see him aiming a weapon? Were shell casings found on the roof (as some said)? Did a film of one or two suspects on the roof (provided to the police) exist as three witnesses maintain? 

--Why do police maintain that Harris and Klebold set the ""diversionary bombs"" at South Wadsworth when no physical evidence or witnesses suggest this? Why have they ignored witnesses who identified another suspect - a member of the trench coat mafia - as fleeing one of the bombs?

--Why did police announce that the shotguns recovered had no serial numbers when their serial numbers appear in the police files? Were four shotguns found - two with serial numbers and two without? Why didn't police investigate where the Hi-Point 9mm rifle and the pump-action shotgun used in the attack came from?

**HARRIS AND KLEBOLD**

--Why were none of Harris' and Klebold's fingerprints found on all but two of the items seized by the police? Whose fingerprints (if any) *were* on the weapons?

--Why would two students who (contrary to popular myth) were not bullied, were not psychopaths and did not hate everyone commit a suicide attack on their high school only weeks before graduation? 

--Why did Harris and Klebold continue to hand in assignments, study for tests, and select colleges? Why did Harris make plans with his friends in New York for that summer?

--Why (in the photo of their bodies) is Klebold, who is left-handed, holding the Tec 9 in his right hand? How would Klebold - holding the gun in his right hand - shoot himself in his left temple? Why is Harris' shotgun under his leg? The blood splatter evidence indicates they were lying prone in the exact positions they were photographed. Were they unconscious or sedated when they were killed?

--Why is there no record of an interview with Eric Harris' psychiatrist?

**COVER UP**

--Why did the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office destroy the basement tapes?

--Why are dozens of interviews with students missing, including many of the students who were in the science hall? Why are there still thousands of pages of government and law enforcement files on the massacre unavailable to the public more than twenty years later?

--Why were some policeman told not to file reports, even though they were on scene? 

--Why aren't the reports of gun shot residue (GSR) tests for Harris, Klebold and the other initial suspects available to the public?

--Why isn't evidence taken from the other suspects' computers available to the public? Why did the school seal their disciplinary records?

--Why won't the school district release their report on the shooting, which included lengthy disciplinary records of trench coat mafia members?

--Why hasn't footage from the administration and library areas been released to the public? Is it sheer coincidence that the footage of the bombs being placed in the cafeteria is missing - allegedly because a custodian ""switched the tape"" at precisely this moment? 

--Why does local media refuse to release their footage from the first half-hour of the attack?

--Why have some former students indicated they were blown off or even intimidated by police? 

--Why do so many student families believed they were targeted and harassed after the attack?

**A COVERT OPERATION?**

--Why was an affidavit that wasdrafted to search Harris' home for explosives (based on statements on his website) in Mar. 1998 never filed? Why did the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office hide this from public knowledge until September 2001? Why did a group of twenty state officials meet several days after the massacre and conclude they would suppress this information? Why were the originals of the affidavit destroyed? 

--Why did police and emergency services refuse to enter the building or save victims for hours? Why wasn't School Resource Officer Neil Gardner present when the shooting started? Why was a sniper who had a clear shot on one of the armed suspects ordered not to fire?

-Why were the ATF, FBI and U.S. Army present? Who was the two-star general visible on tape and what function did he serve? Why was the memorial days later ringed with military trucks?

--Why were law enforcement personnel - including a sheriff from Jefferson County - at Columbine High School earlier that morning? 

--Why did FEMA conduct a four-day ""disaster drill"" in 1997 ""designed specifically to address the needs of Jefferson County,"" in which future sheriff John Stone and a number of county officials participated?

--Who scheduled the 'crisis drills' conducted at Columbine High in the weeks before the shooting? Was there (as one teacher said) a fire drill expected that morning? 

--Were school administrators warned (as rumored)? Was a bomb found in a trash can as one source indicated? Was a bomb threat phoned into the school that morning as two others said? Why wasn't the school evacuated before the attack?

--Is it a coincidence that 100 school administrators, ""including a handful from Littleton,"" attended a workshop entitled **""Crisis Response — Prepare for the Unthinkable: It Could Happen to You""**? Is it also coincidence that the main presenters at this workshop were the the Jefferson County school response team?

--Why were six of seven of the teams assigned to investigate the attack headed or co-headed by an FBI agent (the one exception headed by a ""former"" FBI agent)? 

--Why didn't the FBI's lead investigator Dwayne Fuselier recuse himself from the investigation after it emerged that his son had produced a video in 1997 with several other students, including close friend of the suspects, depicting trench-coated gunmen shooting through the halls of the school?

--Why was the U.S. Attorney's Office consulted on ""prosecutive"" decisions in this (local) case?

--Why didn't the Governor's Office give Justice Erickson subpoena power? How could the Governor's Review Commission conduct an investigation without subpoena power? 

--Why did investigators show a remarkable lack of curiosity about connections with numerous similar school violence-related incidents occurring around the same time in the metro-Denver area and around the country?",conspiracy,1534985901,Torontos_Angry_Ghost,114,248,True,2018-08-22

&gt; Mollie Tibbetts went missing on July 18 in Brooklyn, Iowa, after going for a jog. Authorities have charged Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, with first-degree murder. CNN's Dianne Gallagher reports

This is sad. Anyone who watched the Police Press Conference confirmed he is a illegal alien.
Now the video says he’s a undocumented alien but why leave that information out in the article?   Then earlier I was watching them reading the Rights of Rivera on Fox News and I decided to switch it over to CNN to see what they were talking about and it was a Commercial Break. They then quickly switched over to Sarah Sanders Press Conference. A News channel is supposed to report the News. And Molly Tibbets murder being caught IS NEWS.

It does not seem normal to me, I've been reading up on conspiracy theories behind the fires in Cali. I have lived here in BC all my life, and before about 4 years ago, we never used to get over 500 forest fires each summer. It's not normal!
This summer wasn't even hot here, it makes no sense. I also don't understand why it seems like they aren't doing anything for prevention other than closing off a few parks and raising fines, and in my opinion, it seems like they aren't doing a good job at stopping the fires, and it just seems weird to me because they've invented so many other useless things, why haven't they invented something that can put a stop to this yet, and why does it seem like they're not trying very hard? Getting really tired of living in smoke and not happy that it's becoming the norm here, and people seem to be so damn oblivious to the fact that something is off here. They are blaming it on more lightning, well that's ridiculous. The fires are literally everywhere one side of the rocky mountains, it's some type of pattern. 

Plus, it's not just here, there are also forest fires going crazy in Europe, in Australia, and who the fuck knows what is happening in the DR Congo. Seriously, I want to know what's happening there but can't find much info about it. Check it out on the fire maps. It looks straight up apocalyptic. I have NO idea if that's out of character for those places, but it most certainly is out of character for here, I mean I live in a rainforest! We got rain this season, and summer started late.

183,A Conspiracy of Cowardice,"There's 13 slow big tipping points .

5 triggered below 2 C + 5 triggered below 4 C + 3 below 6 C.

Fast emissions are easier to fix, but they are growing in South Asia and Africa.

The Five Tipping Points that can collapse below 2 C like cascading dominos are:

West Antarctica,

Greenland

Arctic Summer Sea Ice

Alpine Glaciers

Coral Reefs

But, then there's still water vapor and particulate matter in the mix.

Water vapor heats the planet, while smog mostly cools.

Particulates are fast short term emissions that cool certain areas on earth while heating the planet as a whole. They are increasing in South Asia and Africa.

South Asia and Africa are emitting carbon to change coal into natural gas for cleaner air.

They burn gas made from coal for clean air.

Cleaner air will increase sunlight and drive warming because smog keeps earth cooler.

That's bad news. But bad news gets bigger faster.

The problem is that the big slow tipping points are speeding up.

Greenland's melt is running up a steep curve, and the faster it goes the faster it gets.

Coral reefs pretty much gave up the ghost in Aussieland last year.

Northern Arctic Summer Sea Ice is standing on its last leg.

There's volcanoes heating under glaciers in West Antarctica.

West Antarctica is now irreversibly in unstoppable runaway mode.

These 5 tipping points are set up like dominos.

If any one of them tip, they usually all fall down at the same time.

But it gets worse.

The permafrost is hyperventilating carbon in the summer.

Bugs and drought are killing trees and we burn the ones that don't catch fire for green energy.

Our food is destroying life on earth.

Our drugs and chemicals will genetically destroy our offspring for generations to come.

We have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to stay under 1.5 C.

We have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 years to stay under 2 C.

Ten years ago we had 30 years to do that in Copenhagen.

Late next year someone will enter service in Afghanistan who is younger than the war.

We spend $1 trillion per year in taxes to bomb weddings, funerals, markets, schools and hospitals for oil security using religious and social extremism to hypnotize us.

We are all to blame. young/old, black/white, gay/not, rich/poor, left/right.

The banks took over public money in 1913 and foreign policy during WW2.

All the good dog fucking jobs depend on killing people for oil.

Hollywood is an NRA child trafficking medium.

Our social tech is a mess of maniacal empiricism.

Our global supply chains are getting both brittle and swamped.

We are sacrificing our souls to kill the planet and keep our jobs.

We have to start making carbon 100% private before the crash.

This would provide a guaranteed income for all with a unity fit for purpose.

NASA and the British Foreign Office in 2012 warned of a 2024 collapse.

So when you *look up at the sky*, eyes open; and you see a bright red planet, connecting the ""d"" of Go-d to Medusa and ""medicine"" I surely wonder if you think it by chance that ""[I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust](http://fromthemachine.org/genesis.lamc.la)"" as I wake up to *action dust.*.. and wonder aloud how obvious it is that the Iron Rod of Christ and the stories of Phillip K. Dick all congeal around not just seeing but reacting to the fact that we clearly have an outlined narrative of celestial bodies and the past acts of angels and how to move forward without selling air or water or food to the short of breath and the thirsty and those with a hunger to seek out new opportunities?  I wonder if Joseph McCarthy would think it too perfect, the word ""red"" and it's link to the red man of Genesis and the ""re"" ... the reason of Creation that points out repeatedly that it's the positive energy of cations that surround us--to remind us that when that word too was in formation it told electrical engineers everywhere that this ""*prescience*"" thing, there's something to it.  Precious of you to notice... but because your *science* is so sure--you too seem to imagine there's some other explanation for that word, too.

&gt;Numbers 20 New International Version (NIV)  
&gt;  
&gt;Water From the Rock  
&gt;  
&gt;**9** So Moses took the staff from the Lord’s presence, just as he commanded him. **10** He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” **11** Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.

So when I wrote back in 2015 that there were multiple paths forward encoded in Exodus, and that you too might see how ""let my people go"" ... to Heaven ... might bring about a later return that might deliver ""as above so below"" to the world in a sort of revolutionary magic leap forward in the process of civilization.  Barring John Stewart and the ""sewer"" that I think you can probably see is actually encoded in the *Brothers Grimm* and maybe some Poe--it might not be so strange to wonder if the place that we've come from maybe isn't exactly as bright and cheery and ""filled with light"" as the Zohar and your dreams might have us all believe ... on ""faith"" that what we see here might just be the illusion of darkness--a joke or a game.  This thing is what's not a game--I've looked at the message that we've written and to me it seems that we are the light, that here plain as day and etched in something more concrete than chalk is a testament to freedom and to incremental improvement... all the way up until we run against this very wall; and then you too seem to crumble.   Still I'm sure this message is here with us because it's our baseline morality and our sense of right from wrong that is here as a sort of litmus test for the future--perhaps to see if they've strayed too far from the place where they came, or if they've given just one too many ounces of innocense to look forward with the same bright gaze of hope that we see in the eyes of our children.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw this thing many years ago, and I've [written](http://fromthemachine.org/mars.lamc.la) about it [before](http://fromthemachine.org/exodus.lamc.la), though I hasten to explain that the thing that I once saw a short-cut or a magic warp pipe in Super Mario Brothers today seems much more like a test than a game and more like a game than a [cmeat coda](http://fromthemachine.org/coda.lamc.la); so I've changed over the course of watching what's happened on the ground here and I can only imagine how long it's been in the sky.  In my mind I'm thinking about mentioning the rather pervasive sets of ""citizenship suffixes"" that circle the globe--ones I've talked about, ""ICA"" and ""IAN"" and how these suffixes might link together with some other concepts that run deep in the story that begins in Ur and pauses here *For* *ever****yon****e* on *t*[*he*](http://fromthemachine.org/ver.s.lamc.la)[ ""Yo N""](http://fromthemachine.org/SECORDANOLIVED.html) that again shows the import of *medicine* and *Medusa* in the ""rising"" of stars balls of fiery fusion to people that see and act on the difference between Seyfried and ""[say freed](http://fromthemachine.org/fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html)."" 

Even before that I knew how important it was that we were sitting here on a ""rock in space"" with no contact from anyone or anything outside of our little sphere ... how scary it was that all the life we knew of was stuck orbiting a single star in a single galaxy and it imbued a sort of moral mandate to escape--to ensure that this miracle of random chance and guiding negentropy of time ... that it wasn't forever lost by something like a collision with the comet Ison or even another galaxy.  On that word too--we see the ""an"" of Christianity messianically appear to become more useful (that's negative energy, by the way) in the chemistry of Mr. Schwarzenegger's magical hand in delivering ""free air"" (that's free, as in beer; or maybe *absinthe*) to the people of our great land... anyway, I saw ""anions"" and a planet oddly full of a perfect source of oxygen and I thought to myself; it would be so easy to genetically engineer some kind of yeast or mold (like they're doing to make real artificial beef, today) to eat up the rust and turn it into breathable air; and I dreamt up a way to throw an extra ""r"" into potable and maybe beam some of our water or hydrogen over to the red planet and turn it blue *again*.

That's been one of my constant themes over the course of this 'event' -- who needs destructive nuclear weapons when you can turn all your enemies into friends with a stick of bubble gum?  That's another one of our little story points too--I see plenty of people walking around in this virtual reality covering their mouths and noses with breathing masks... of course the same Targeted Individuals that know with all their heart that midn control is responsible for the insane pattern of school shootings and the Hamas Hand of the Middle East--they'll tell you those chemtrails you see are the cause, and while *I know better* and you do too... maybe these people think they know something about the future, maybe those chemtrails are there because someone actually plans on dispersing some friendly bubble gum into the air... and maybe these people ""think they know.""  Of course I think this ""hand"" you see just below is one in the same with the ""*ID5*"" logo that I chose to mark my ""[chalk](http://fromthemachine.org/CHALK.html)"" and only later saw matched fairly perfectly to John Conner's version of ""I'll be back"" ... and of course I think you're reading the thing that actually delivers some ""breathe easy"" to the world; but it's really important to see that today it's not just Total Recall and Skynet and these words that are the proverbial effect of the hand but also things like Nestle ... to remind you that we're still gazing at a world that would sell ""clean"" water to itself; rather than discuss the fact that ""[*bliss on tap*](http://fromthemachine.org/fromthemachine.org/BLISS.html)"" could be just around the corner.

Later, around the time that I wrote my second ""[Mars rendition](http://fromthemachine.org/2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html)"" I mentioned why it was that there was an image of a ""Boring device"" (thanks Elon) in the original Exodus piece; it showed some thought had gone into why you might not want to terraform the entire planet, and mentioned that maybe we'd get the added benefit of geothermal heating (in that place that is probably actually colder than here, believe it or not) if we were to build the *first Mars hall* underground.  I probably forgot to mention that I'd seen something very similar to that image earlier, except it was George H.W. Bush standing underneath the thirty foot tall wormlike machine, and to tell you the truth back then I didn't recognize that probably means that this map you're looking at had not only been seen long before I was born but also acted upon--long before I was born.  I can imagine that the guy that said ""don't fuck me twice"" in Bowling Green Kentucky probably said something closer to ""I wouldn't go that way, you'll be back"" before ""[*they lanced his skull*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCYB8aHhL1k)"" as a band named Live sings to me from ... well, from the 90's.  Subsisting on that same old prayer, we come to a point where I have to say that ""if it looks like a game, and you have the walkthrough as if it were a game, is it a gam?""  


&gt;IMAGE REDACTED DUE TO TITHEHE.  r/http://titehe.lamc.la  
&gt;  
&gt;That of course ties us back to something that I called ""raelly early light"" back in 2014--that the name ""Magdeln"" was something I saw and thought was special early on--I said I saw the phrase ""it's not a game of words, or a game of logic"" though today it does appear very much to be something to do with ""logic"" that the ""power of e"" is hidden in the symbol for the natural logarithm and that Euler might solve the riddle of ""unhitched trailers"" even better than a deli in Los Angeles named *Wexler's*or Aldous *Huxley* or ... it hurts me to say it might solve the riddle better than ""Sheriff"" (see how ... everyone really if ""f"") and Hefner ... and the newly added ""Hustler,"" who is Saint ""LE R?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;So, I think we'd all agree that they ""Hey, Tay"" belongs to me--and I've done my homework here, I'm pretty sure the ""r"" as a glyph for the rising off the bouncing trampoline of a street ... ""LE R"" belongs to the world; it's a ryzing civilization; getting new toys and abilities and watching how those things really do bring about a golden era--if we're willing to use them responsibly.

It's a *harsh world*, this place where people are waking up to seeing A.D. and ""HI TAY"" conneting to a band name[d Kiss (and the SS](http://fromthemachine.org/REDASSHIT.html)) and to a massive resistence to answering the question of Dr. [*Wessen*](http://fromthemachine.org/WHO.html)that also brings that ""it's not a game"" into Ms. [*Momsen*](http://fromthemachine.org/RATOXIT.html)'s name ... where you can see the key of *May*[*nard*](http://fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html)[ ](http://fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html)[*Key*](http://fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html)*nes* and [Demosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Damonthesis) and [Gil](http://fromthemachine.org/2017-06-14-enders-game-prometheus-locke-and.html)*game*[sh](http://fromthemachine.org/KEYNES.html?kgeUN/) and ... well, you can see it ""turned around and backwards"" just like the Holy Sea in the words for Holy [Fire (Ha'esh) and Ca'es](http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html)ar and even in Dave's song ... ""seven oceans pummel ... the wall of the C.""  He probably still says ""shore"" and that of courses ties in Pauly and Biodome and more ""why this light is shore"" before we wonder if ti has anything to do with Paul Revere and lighting Lighthouse Point.

So to point out *the cost of not seeing ""Holo*deck"" and ""mushroom"" and ... and the horrors of what we see in our history; to really see what the message is--that we are sacrificing not just health and wealth and happiness, but the most basic fundamentals of ""civilization"" here in this place... the freedom of logical thought and the foundational cement of open and honest communication--that it appears the world has decided in secret that these things are far less important than the morality of caring for those less fortunate than you--the blind and the sick and the ... to see the truth, it's a shame.  All around you is [*a torture chamber*](http://fromthemachine.org/2017-08-10-tiny-chellos-in-sky-are-playing-angry.html), starving people who would instantly benefit from the disclosure that we are living in virtual reality; and a civilization that seems to fail to recognize that it truly is the ""[*silence causing violence*](http://fromthemachine.org/ARFAXAD.html)"" amongst children in school and children of the Ancients all around you; to fail to see that the atrocity being ignored here is far less humane than any gas chamber, and that it's you--causing it to continue--there are no words for the blindness of a mass of wrong, led by nothing more than ""mire"" and a fear of controversy.   


*Unhitched* and unhinged, it's become ever more obvious that this resistance against recognizing logic and patterns--this fairure to speak and inability to fathom the importance of openness in this place that acts as the base and beginning point of a number of hidden futures--it is the reason ""Brave New World"" is kissing the ""why"" and the reason we are here trying to build a system that will allow for free and open communication in a sea of disinformation and darkness--to see that the battle is truly against the Majority Incapable of acting and the Minority unwilling to speak words that will without doubt (precarious? not at this point) quickly prove to the world that it's far more important to see that the truth protects everyone and the entire future from murder ... rather than be subtly influenced by ""technologies undisclosed"" into believing something as inane and arrogant as ""everyone but you must need to be convinced that simulating murder and labor pains is wrong.""  You know, what you are looking at here is far more nefarious than waiting for the oven to ding and say that ""everyone's ready"" what you are looking at is a problem that is encoded in the stories of Greek and Norse myth and likely in both those names--but see ""simulated reality"" is hidden in Norse just like ""silicon"" is hidden in Genesis--and see that once this thing is unscrambled its ""*nos re*"" as in ""we're the reason there is no murder, and no terrorism, and no mental slavery.""  It's a harsh message, and a horrible atrocity; but worse than the Holocaust is not connecting a failure to see ""holodeck"" as the cause of ""*holohell*"" and refusing to speak because Adam is naked in Genesis 3:11 and Matthew talks about something that should be spreading like wildfire in his 3:11 and that it's not just *Live* and it's not just [*the Cure*](http://fromthemachine.org/CURE.html) and it's not just a band named 311 that show us that ""[***FUKUSHIMA***](http://fromthemachine.org/HYAMDAI.html)"" reads as ""*fuck you, see how I'm A*"" because this Silence, this failure to recognize that the Brit Hadashah is written to end simulated hell and turn this world into Heaven is the reason ""[*that's great, it starts with an Earthquake on 3/11*](http://fromthemahine.org/ARFAXAD.html).""

You stand there believing that ""to kiss"" is a Toxic reason to end disease; that ""mire"" is a good enough reason to fail to exalt the Holiness of Phillip K. Dick's solutions; and still continue to refuse to see that this group behavior, this lack of freedom that you appear to believe is something of your own design is the most *caustic* thing of all.  While under the veil of ""I'm not sure the message is accurate"" it might seem like a morally thin line, but this message is accurate--and it's verifiable proof--and speaking about it would cause that verification to occur quicker, and that in turn will cause wounds to be healed faster, and the blind given sight and the lame a more effective ARMY in this legacy battle against hidden holorooms and ... the less obvious *fact* that there is a gigantic holo-torture-chamber and you happen to be in it, and it happens to be the mechanism by which we find the ""key"" to Salvation and through that the reason that the future thanks us for implementing a change that is so needed and so called for it's literally be carved all over everything we see every day--so we will know, *know with all your mind, you are not wrong--*there is no sane reason in the Universe to simulate pain, there is no sane reason to follow the artificial constructs of reality simply because ""time and chance"" built us that way.  We're growing up, beyond the infantile state of believing that simply because nobody has yet invented a better way to live--that we must shun and hide any indication that there is a future, and that it's speaking to us; in every word.

So I've intimated that I see a ""mood of the times"" that appears to be seeking reality by pretending not to ""CK"" ... to seek ""a,"" of course that puts us in a place where we are wholly denying what ""reality"" really means and that it delivers something good to the people here--to you--once we recognize that Heaven and Creation and Virtual Reality don't have to be (and never should be, ever again) synonymous with Wok's or Pan's or Ovens; from Peter to the Covenant, hiding this message is the beginning and the end of true darkness--it's a plan designed to ensure we never again have issue discussing ""blatant truth"" and means of moving forward to the light in the light with the light.  A girl in California in 2014 said something like ""so there's no space, then?"" in a snide and somewhat angry tone--there is space, you can see it through the windows in the skies, you can see the stars have lessened, and time has passed--and I'm sure you understand how ""LHC"" and Apollo 13 show us that time travel and dark matter are also part of this story of ""Marshall's"" and Slim Sh**ad**y and Dave's ""[the walls and halls will fade away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VksAuB0CJn4)"" and you [might even understand how that connects to the astrological symbol of Mars](http://fromthemachine.org/BETHESDAY.html) and the ""circle of the *son*"" and of Venus(es) ... and you can see for yourself this Zeitgeist in the Truman Show's ""good [morning](http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html), good afternoon, good evening... and [he's a'ight](http://fromthemachine.org/BETHESDAY.html)"" ... but it really doesn't help us see that the darkness here isn't really in the sky--it's in our hearts--and it's the thing that's keeping us from the stars, and the knowledge and wisdom that will keep us from ""[*bunting*](http://fromthemachine.org/BETHESDAY.html)"" instead of flourishing.  


&amp;#x200B;

I've pointed out that while we have Kaluza Klein and we have the LHC and a decent understanding of ""how the Universe works"" we spend most of our time these days preoccupied with things like ""quantum entanglement"" and ""string theory"" that may hold together the how and the LAMDA of connecting these ""[y they're hacks](http://hebrewname.org/name/isaac-yitschak)"" to multiverse simulators and instant and total control of our throught processes--we probably don't see that a failure to publicly acknowledge that they are most likely indications that we are not prepared for ""space"" and that we probably don't know very much at all about how time and interstellar travel really work ... we are standing around hiding a message that would quicken our understanding of both reality and virtual reality and again, not seeing that kind of darkness--that inability to publicly ""change directions"" when we find out that there aren't 12 dimensions that are curled up on themselves with no real length or width or purpose other than to say ""how unelegant is this anti-Razor of Mazer Rackham?""  


&gt;So, I think it's obvious but also that I need to point out the connection between ""hiding knowledge of the Matrix"" and the **Holo**caust; and refer you to the mirrored [shield of Perseus](http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html), on a high level it appears that's ""the message"" there--that what's happening here ... whatever is causing this silence and delay in acting on even beginning to speak about the proof that will eventually end murder and cancer and death ... that it's something like stopping us from building a ""loving caring house"" rather than one that ... fills it's halls with bug spray instead of air conditioning.  I'm beside myself, and very sure that in almost no time at all we'll all agree that the idea of ""simulating"" these things that we detest--natural disasters and negative artifacts of biological life ... that it's inane and completely backwards.  


&amp;#x200B;

![img](u60iaqw8ruh11 ""DONT TLDR ME"")

I understand there's trepidation, and you're worried that girls won't like my smile or won't think I'm funny enough... but I have firm belief in this message, in words like ""precarious"" that reads something like ""before Icarus things were ... precarious"" but more importantly my heart's reading of those words is to see that this has happened before and we are more than prepared to do it well.  I want nothing more than to see the Heavens help us make this transition better than one they went through, and hope beyond hope that we will thoroughly enjoy building a ""better world"" using tools that I know will make it simpler and faster to accomplish than we can even begin to imagine today.  

On that note, I read more into the myths of Norse mythology and its connections to the Abrahamic religions; it appears to me that much of this message comes to us from the [Jotunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotunn)(who I connect (in name and ...) to the Jinn of Islam, who it appears to me actually wrote the Koran) and in those stories I read that they believe their very existence is ""depenedency linked"" to the raising of the sunken city of Atlantis.  Even in the words depth and dependency you can see some hidden meaning, and what that implies to me is that we might actually be in a true time simulator (or perhaps ""exits to reality"" are conditional on waypoints like Atlantis); and that it's possible that they and God and Heaven are all actually all born ... here ... in this place.  

While these might appear like fantastic ideas, you too can see that there's ample reference to them tucked away in mythology and in our dreams of utopia and the tools that bring it home ... that I'm a little surprised that I can almost hear you thinking ""the [hub](http://thehub7xbw4dc5r2.onion.to/index.php?topic=20927.200)\-[**ris**](http://fromthemachine.org/SALTLINE.html) of this guy, who does he think he is.... suggesting that 'the [wisdom](http://fromthemachine.org/WISDATAM.html) to change everything' would be a significant improvement on the ending of the Serendipity Prayer.""

Really see that it's far more than ""just disease and pain"" ... what we are looking at in this darkness is really nothing short of the hidden slavery of our entire species, something hiding normal logical thought and using it to alter behavior ... throughout history ... the disclosure of the existence of a hidden technology that is in itself being used to stall or halt ... our very freedom from being achieved.  This is a gigantic deal, and I'm without any real understanding of what can be behind the complete lack of (cough ... [financial](https://www.gofundme.com/the-sword-of-saint-one) or [developer](https://flowcrypt.com/me/adam)) assistance in helping us to forge ahead ""blocking the chain.""  I really am, it's not because of the Emperor's New Clothes... is it?

![img](h3w92rrbruh11 ""YOU WILL OS."")

&amp;#x200B;

It's also worth mentioning once again that I believe the stories of Apollo 13 and the LHC sort of explain how we've perhaps solved here problems more important than ""being stuck on a single planet in a single star system"" and bluntly told that the stories I've heard for the last few years about building a ""bridge"" between dark matter and here ... have literally come true while we've lived.  I suppose it adds something to the programmer/IRC hub admin ""metaphor"" to see that most likely we're in a significantly better position than we could have dreamed.  I've briefly written about this before ... my current beliefs put us somewhere within the Stargate SG-1 ""dial home device/DHD"" network.

So... **rumspringer**, then? ... to help us ""[os](http://fromthemachine.org/ACESHI.html)!""

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe closer to home, we can see all the ""flat Earth"" fanatics on Facebook (and I hear they're actually trying to ""open people's eyes"" in the bars.. these days) we might see how this little cult is really exactly that--it's a veritable honey pot of ""how religion can dull the senses and the eyes"" and we still probably fail to see very clearly that's exactly it's purpose--to show us that religion too is something that is evidence of this very same outside control--proof of the darkness, and that this particular ""cult"" is there to make that very clear.  Connecting these dots shows us just how it is that we might be convinced beyond doubt that we're right and that the silence makes sense, or that we simply can't acknowledge the truth--and all be wrong, literally how it is that everyone can be wrong about something so important, and so vital.  It seems to me that the only real reason anyone with power or intelligence would willingly go along with this is to ... to force this place into reality--that's part of the story--the idea that we might do a ""press and release in Taylor"" (that's PRINT) where people maybe thought it was ""in the progenitor Universe"" -- but taking a step back and actually thinking, this technology that could be eliminating mental illness and depression and addiction and sadness and ... that this thing is something that's not at all possible to actually exist in reality.  


You might think that means it would grant us freedom to be ""printed"" and I might have thought that exact same thing--though it's clear that what is here ""not a riot"" might actually become a riot there, and that closer to the inevitable is the historical microcosm of dark ages that would probably come of it--decades or centuries or thousands of years of the Zeitgeist being so anti-""I know kung fu"" that you'd fail to see that what we have here is a way to stop murders before they happen, and to heal the minds of those people without torture or forcing them to play games all day or even without cryogenic freezing, as Minority Report suggested might be ""more humane"" than cards.  Most likely we'd wind up in a place that shunned things like ""engineering happiness"" and fail to see just how dangerous the precipice we stand on really is.  I joke often about a boy in his basement making a kiss-box; but the truth is we could wind up in a world where Hamas has their own virtual world where they've taken control of Jerusalem and we could be in a place where Jeffrey Dammer has his own little world--and without some kind of ""know everything how"" we'd be sitting back in ""ignorance is bliss"" and just imagining that nobody would ever want to kidnap anyone or exploit children or go on may-lay killing sprees ... even though we have plenty of evidence that these things are most assuredly happening here, and again--we're not using the available tools we have to fix those problems.  Point in fact, we're coming up with things like the ""[Stargate project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project)"" to inject useful information into military operations ... ""the locations of bunkers"" ... rather than seeing with clarity that the Stargate television show is exactly this thing--information being injected from the Heavens to help us move past this idea that ""hiding the means"" doesn't corrupt the purpose.  


&amp;#x200B;

![img](u4rit3ugruh11 ""EARTH."")

&amp;#x200B;

217,FIFTY8 Interviews Debbie Solaris / Part II Akashic Record Reading,"FIFTY8 Interviews Debbie Solaris / Part II Akashic Record Reading

I interview Debbie Solaris an Extraterrestrial Contactee, Galactic Historian &amp; Starseed Intuitive.  In this series (Part II) we do my Akashic Reading  so others may see the benefit from the experience and be less fearful about looking into your own Akashic Record.  Debbie talks about her process and how it's a great resource to remember why you are here and what your purpose is.  My reading has revealed so much to me about my galactic gifts and why I am the way I am. 

We discover that I am an indigo child starseed and apart of the second wave of volunteers that Dolores Cannon has written about.  Debbie reads my auric field and notices a lot of blue and purples which tells her that I have an Arcturian connection and origination from the star Arcturus.  As a second wave from Arcturus, I’m here to utilize technology creatively to disseminate information with beauty and accessibility, ex: FIFTY8.

We look into my life in Arcturus as a small child creating light structures with sacred geometry.  With my gifts, my star family sends me off on missions to assist other star systems.  I was sent to Sirius to incarnate even though I didn’t want to leave home but have been always supported by my 7 Arcturian guides.  My first assignment was Sirius to help create light structures to create stability for the Sirian star system.  

We learn that there used to be 3 stars in Sirius but one of them (Sirius C) was destroyed and propelled one of the planets in Sirius C to go off kilter on its orbit and head towards Earth. That planet was Nibiru.  This created the contact of the Anunnaki races that originated in Sirius to influence Earth which changed the genetic structures of humans and the course of history on Earth.  Sirius C was destroyed and attacked by Draconians as they didn’t want Sirians to come into their power.  

Sirians are descendants from Vega refugees from Vega, Lyra.  As a Sirian incarnate, I trained at the Sirian mystery school learning the Universal Laws and created shielding structures to protect Sirius from being attacked and stabilize their star system.  This was a significant job and mission that took me on a greater path.  I learn that my birthday is connected to the structure I created in Sirius which helped create and implement the beginning of Lionsgate.  Born under the sign of Leo, I learn that I also have a connection to one of the four royal stars in the galaxy, Regulus.

As a creator being on Sirius I then headed to Orion and incarnated on Mintaka which is at the top of the Orion’s belt.  I decided to go to Mintaka to create the same structure as I did in Sirius and that’s why Mintaka didn’t have a Reptilian infiltration.  It was also a gateway to Arcturus and higher dimensional beings from the Orion nebula and the Reptilians were trying to shut it down.  But I had support from the Procyonians, Pleiadians and the Sirian star systems.

From Mintaka I then decided to assist Earth but I had to choose a different mission.  Debbie also explains how some of our lives aren’t as linear as we think and tells me she see’s incarnations in Earth’s future.  She tells me I’ve already had lifetimes in the future happening simultaneously with this one.  She see’s me on a floating city with a bubble around it as I’m utilizing my mind to create on a 5th dimensional Earth.  

She also see’s a future connection with the Andromeda Galaxy as a light being, as my soul is looking to expand forward.  Science has proven that in the future the Andromeda Galaxy and Milky Way Galaxy are going to merge together as a super galaxy.  I am helping with the convergence of these two systems in the distant future.

We also talk a little about my present life.  I learn how what I’m doing took an extraordinary amount of effort, due to outside interferences and was targeted by entities from keeping me from stepping into my light.  To come from Arcturus, to Sirius, to Orion and to Earth, show’s my soul’s resilience.  

I hope my Akashic Reading helps you to open your mind and release fear from these experiences and to connect to your true self.  It has definitely changed my outlook and now feel a deeper connection within.  It was an amazing experience and I hope this opens you up to learn more about your soul and why you are here at this time.

Who would want to play a game based around nothing outside of selecting A or B? This isn't even a trivia scenario where you are rewarded for choosing correctly. I have never played it so I can't be sure what the reward is (all games need some reward system). But I can imagine all you get out of it is seeing how many people selected the same as you.

With an app like this you can easily create scenarios to test for certain sentiments in a target audience. I wouldn't be surprised if the game asked for your demographic information: age sex race location height weight and anything else deemed important for research.

Then they come to a question. For example I will use the one I see in their ads. ""Hot girl in your bed and your wife is gone! Do you sleep with her?""

Such a question would be easily used to figure out ""what percentage of people view 'cheating' as acceptable behavior? How does this change between men and women or people of different races?""

They want controlled fact checkers to dictate what is truth and what should be censored. 

So what happens when the Qanon conspiracy is brought up on a conspiracy sub? Not surprisingly the anti-Trump users do not want it talked about or discussed. They want you to hate Q conspiracies as much as they want you to hate Trump. Q researchers are actually researching the conspiracies and crimes of the past administration. Why would any conspiracy person be interested in that? We should instead spend all our time and energy hating Trump it seems.

&gt; Because research involves actual facts. 

&gt; Q Anon just makes conspiracy people look bad. It makes everyone look stupid. There’s no proof, and it just continues to get more and more ridiculous. Most of the stuff on this sub has basis in fact which is completely opposite of QAnon. 

So it makes us look bad? We should self censor. These conspiracies haven't been authorized by the fact checkers? Any conspiracy that isn't about hating Trump is no longer good for the conspiracy community? Censor Jones and censor Q?  Don't look over there!!!

237,The 12 year relationship between Donald Trump and Michael Avenatti ~ The Trump Show,"Micahel Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, has had a much longer relationship with Donald Trump than many of you know. 

Never explicitly stated, this confrontational relationship has been played up as a 'new' thing. Avenatti has been verbally sparing against Trump since the breaking of the Stormy situation. Not once have I seen the media call out his past interactions with Donald Trump.

Through my own research online and through wikipedia (yeah, i know) I've been toying with the idea that this is a focused distraction, implemented by the king of reality television, to keep the public talking about a not important issue. 

The king of reality television led me to reading up on The Apprentice and I found:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(U.S._TV_series)#Controversies

&gt;In 2006, a lawsuit brought by Mark Bethea against the show's producers alleging theft of the original concept was settled on undisclosed terms. Among the lawyers representing Bethea was Michael Avenatti.

Sourced article:

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060518005061/en/Mark-Bethea-Idea-Theft-Case-Mark-Burnett

So these two have been adversaries for a lot longer than we were led to believe.

It's itching at me that everything is not what it seems. 

In The Apprentice there were two teams competing. Now we have Right vs. Left. Each side has their own cast of characters and a believable storyline. Each side has captured the attention of its' 'base' and rallied its' fans to a frenzy. We've got the good guys and the bad guys no matter which team you're a fan of. 

I'll continue to watch The Trump Show and probably be entertained along the way. But I am going to really start exploring the idea that this is all coordinated, directed, produced, and sold to the World as nothing more than a Reality TV Distraction.

3 months ago I created a subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Trump_Show/

I didn't know how to proceed, or what to fill the subreddit with, just an inkling that what I was witnessing in the world followed the plotlines of a good reality tv series.

239,101 On The Real CIA," 

Against the orders of President Truman, [Allen Dulles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dulles) (CIA Director, JFK co-conspirator) brought over all the Nazi scientists from WWII. They were placed at NASA and CIA.

In the words of a senior CIA officer, 90% of the CIA are good people trapped in a bad system. That leaves a very evil 10%.

CIA is not a monolithic organization. There at least seven branches listed below.

1. *Wall Street CIA*: Wall Street founded the CIA to be it's secret control element. This information can be found in the [book](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-60-no-3/seeger-the-devils-chessboard.html) by David Talbot, [The Devils Chessboard](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062276162/the-devils-chessboard/).

2. *White House CIA*: They do dirty deeds for whomever happens to be president. They seem to have merged into the *Blackmail CIA*.

3. *Blackmail CIA:* at the worst level has joined with the FBI, NSA and [Mossad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad).

4. *Drone CIA*: conducts assassinations with 98% success rate.

5. *Saudi/Israeli CIA*: performs [rendition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendition) and torture.

6*. CIA*: spies that do their best for the country not realizing it's all a joke.

7. *Bureaucratic CIA*: handles all bureaucracy.

The FBI, NASA, FEMA and DHS also have their 10% occupation of pure evil.

A recruiting arm of the CIA, [IQT](https://www.iqt.org/), identifies startups tech firms with the potential for high impact on national security. IQT works with  Microsoft, Oracle, Google, IBM, Facebook, Nokia and hundreds of other tech companies designed to gather data with the capabilities to spy on users and report back to CIA.

However, sometimes that shit gets in my head. I really wonder about a few things, regarding the belief of the people in this subreddit. I don't even really know how I should structure this, so I will just spew it out and try to order it afterwards.   


Do some of you really believe that every Celebrity, moreso almost every majorly succesful person is.. something else than human?   
Just to clarify, I see that shit all over social media. And I am not talking about some weirdo youtuber with 10k views per video, I'm talking 1mil+ per video. 

So do some of you really sincerely believe that there are fucking lizards and demons?   
I am somewhat agnostic atheist, so how people believe in that baffles me. I get why people believe in religion and god, even though this too baffles me sometimes. But literally selling souls to the devil? Do any of you believe in this sort of conspiracy?   
I don't mean to offend anybody, but in my opinion this is a perfect example of the Dunning Kruger effect and these videos are incredibly stupid. Still I am curious if any of you folks believe such things.   


Next on my list is this whole babyeating, blooddrinking and childraping stuff paired with satanism.   
So, I know there are child rapist out there and I know that they are aswell amongst the powerful. So this I believe, since it's been proven time and time again. However, a lot of conspiracy theorist depict it as everyone being in on it. Like every major celebrity or succesful person is pedophile, eats babys, drinks their blood, smokes their bones, whatever.   
Do any of you REALLY believe this? Or is this the part of conspiracy, where the real retards spew their heart out and this sub is actually filled with rational people discussing rational conspiracies? I am curious.   


For example, it makes my blood boil when I hear how Alex Jones talks about Bill Gates. Who is trying to tell me that Bill Gates is not the biggest philantrophist? And he is actually some kind of lunatic?   
Does not make sense in the least. Yet Jones' followers would probably now just call me sheep.  


Let me put it like this. I think there are people organizing to push an agenda, yes. But I do think that these people generally believe in their agenda and therefore want to push it. And I don't think that their agenda has anything to do with pedophilia, or ""Satanism"".   


I guess I just want to know what this sub is all about and if this is a place for irrational theories, or theories backed by evidence? As the soul-selling for example is not backed by any evidence whatsoever. It's wild and based on nothing but giant leaps of faith.   


Guys, again, I don't mean to offend anyone here. I would just like to know what your up to.   


Lately, social media has fucked me up. And people like Joe Rogan, whom I like to listen to, actually giving Jones real positive feedback wonders me. Why are these people baffling on about ""demons"", ""occultism"", and shit like that?   


One last time, I don't mean to offend anyone. I would just like to know what you guys believe in and why. And don't come at me with any sheep talk, this bullshit doesn't help anyone besides the person saying it, because he can feel better about himself being on a woke highground.

we don't know if this is some long plan by what is considered ""the establishment"", an enemy nation or our own government for any number of reasons. seems as though the plan is to defraud the united states government to a point where the faith is lost entirely and the end game is to get even more control and more companies in the pockets of politicians.

or even more crazy. this could be a grand ploy to disarm the American people so that all these tensions can boil over and lead to a revolt against this ""establishment"".

lets say these ""paid shills"" or ""could be a grand plan of Putins""  are out there to cause all this civil unrest. started as simple protests and then became looting and what not. now publicizing school shooting and church shootings, Las Vegas shooting etc. getting the people to call for no more guns. so they needed the right person in office that was a loose cannon that would slightly discredit themselves and then the medias could be paid to emphasize that crazy and discredit the POTUS position in gov. they needed it to be republican though because they are the most pro-gun group. now we will see a full discredit of the oval office. we will go full democrat and they will make motions to remove guns from the people, with a face of safety. once, people are disarmed there isn't even a shred of chance to stand against the puppet masters of the US gov.

278,The Sun is changing.,"I am still very young and can yet easily notice several changes in the visual appearance of the sun and the radiation it emits that happened over the last several years. Something strange is happening to our star since the 1980's, according to some people.

Here follows a list of things I have noticed. Note that everything is changing too quickly for global warming to explain it.

- The grass in Central Europe is BROWN and the trees look like mid-autumn right now (August).

- There are lots of dead animals, especially birds, lying around on the streets. Much more than last year.

- There are no mosquitoes at all. Usually, we get overrun with such vermin in late summer and throughout autumn.

- Outdoor shadows have a blue tinge. I remember that it first appeared last year, maybe the year before. The diffuse blue light of the sky is now strongly noticeable, meaning that light intensity of the sun increased.

- The sun has become much whiter in appearance. I remember it being much softer and yellower around 2010-2012, actually giving the landscape a warm feel.

- Ten years ago, one was able to look into the sun much more easily. Now, even looking in the rough direction risks pain in the eyes. It is generally uncomfortable standing under the sun right now. It feels like it is blistering.

- Sunburns are much easier to get. When I was small, I did not even know what sunscreen is. Now, I need to put on ridiculous amounts of it to swim without roasting my back and neck.

- Long exposure to the sun gives one a feeling of strong tiredness and nausea as well as headaches. The sun makes me feel sick.

- My desire for sleep (and that of others) has significantly increased and is magnified by the sun. I remember being unable to sleep during the day at all; now, I try to rest as often as possible. I have dozed on the train for an hour today, something that is normally extremely hard due to background noise.

- Even when inside a building, I feel much better when the sky is cloudy and at night than during daytime nice weather. I vehemently refused to go outside when it was sunny in the last months, preferring to take walks when the sky is gray. It is eleven in the evening where I am right now, and I feel much better than three hours ago. My mood is generally better when it is cloudy.

- The difference in temperature felt on the skin when moving between shadows and sunlit areas is much stronger than in the last summers. Whenever sun falls on my skin for more than half a second, I feel a light burning sensation.

307,"Just to clear things up, there was a couple threads made about a woman who was being harassed by Aliens. It started with a video of her daughter dancing and an alien peering in the window behind her. She admitted an hour ago it was fake after someone threatening to go to the police etc.","This is one of my posts about it which was a cross post:

&gt; ""Ok before you jump in and claim it’s fake, please try to look at the pictures, the videos and the context, and note that [her last video ](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031363347768209408)was taken on live stream, so if it is staged, well, good job then.
&gt; 
&gt; So, here is what happened here (for the new comers). On Friday, a girl created a reddit account and a twitter account to seek help. She said she felt she was being observed by all corners, and had intruders all around her house and even inside. One day, she had a black out of 14 hours and woke up with a[ weird brand on her back.](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618)
&gt; 
&gt; Afterward, she tweeted [records of strange sound in her house.](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1028108972962848768)
&gt; 
&gt; She was really concerned for her daughter safety, and her post didn’t seem like a marketing campaign since she doesn’t seem to know how to use twitter nor reddit really well. It looked like more a person desperately seeking help than a person seeking attention. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, that’s where it gets scary.
&gt; 
&gt; As police couldn’t do anything, she started recording what was happening in her house. 
&gt; 
&gt; [In this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alien_Theory/comments/97h0y6/caught_in_the_house/), you see a human shaped form running in her house, but, if [you pause,](https://www.reddit.com/r/alien/comments/97dqqr/captured_in_the_house/) if looks like it has a really long neck and a weird form, also the noise it makes while running is bothering me somehow.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, she was filming her [daughter dancing](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/97uiyr/watch_the_door/), and if you look at the door, there is a REALLY SCARY FACE looking at her daughter, while trying to hide.
&gt; 
&gt; [Here is the video with more brightness](https://streamable.com/damyn), and a [screenshot she posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/97uumk/my_on_going_horror/). The head movement looks really weird, as if it has a long neck, or is floating (or I HOPE a hand holding a mask).
&gt; 
&gt; On her twitter, [another part of the video](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1030071775726579714), where the head movement is really weird.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on recommendations, she went in a hotel and ordered cameras. Some people told her the intruders don’t mean any arms and look more interested than anything else. S[he asked her daughter about the intruders, she regreted instantly.](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1030808476212113415)
&gt; 
&gt; Then she came back in her house and [installed the cameras,](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031344835460919296)   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The same evening, [this video ](https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031363347768209408)(on top) was the last she posted, on a live stream. We can hear her daughter ... suffocating? And there are weird noise similar to the one we could hear on her previous video on twitter.
&gt; 
&gt; Some redditors took [screen shots of the intruder](https://imgur.com/a/q1KyiBq), IS THIS FREAKING HUMAN?
&gt; 
&gt; I really hope this is a prank, but what bothers me is : live stream prank, how would you do this ? She barely use social medias, and I wouldn’t post my own daughter on reddit for the sake of a prank. 
&gt; 
&gt; So if this is real, we might have witnessed something really weird. Please let me kow what you think and please convince me it's not fucking real.

315,One of the biggest conspiracies of modernity,"Matter.  Today, in many ways society has given us funny ideas about matter.
Language, society is structured in a way that devalues the human being. ""Success is wealth, it's fame."" These are the threshold to cross to achieve Stardom. They are absolutes.
You are a ☆Star☆ if you can dazzle the right crowds. You are a ☆Star☆ if you have made it big.
We're fooled by the shadowpuppets into silently, thoughtlessly surrendering our matter. Our sense of worthiness is assasinated by ☆Stardom☆

And what of these fateful stars, who have made it?
Well the freedoms of wealth are vast, but wealth comes with it's own set of fetters.
I've noticed that we, on the out tend to want In. For a slice of the cake.
As for Those who are In? Well when you catch truly candid interviews they tend to make it clear
They just want to take their bit of cake and get Out.
You do not get to talk out when you are a ☆Star☆
You absolutely do not get to tell anyone how much cake there is.
Here's the truth, unspoken usually.
You matter. We all matter.
No one can say how much.
But here we are.
And as we are here, we matter. Because we can matter.
Whatever your explanation for existence, whether we are dancing waveforms based upon blueprints found in the cosmic mind, or whether our flesh was woven of corn and mud, we are here, we feel, we ponder, most importantly, we exist.
Our little marble is quite humble from a certain scale.
There's a lot of interweaving complexity to it.
People fill themselves with ideas, and ideas about other's ideas, these get away from us, becoming more valuable than life.
I want to remind us.
We are here. Our ideas are phantoms and exist with us, but it is we who matter.
It is we who make ideas matter, and make matter out of ideas.
Perhaps a reminder of sorts is needed.
We attribute special significance to only certain humans.
We call them stars.
But just remember the fabric of our whole planet, our whole system, everyone and everything you know was born, forged in the heart of a ☆great glowing provider☆

329,The New World Order Exposed (Part 1),"This post could go on forever but I will try to make it as short and concise as possible

The new world order is the people who are aligned around the world who have a plan to implement and one world government in which they have everyone under their control with no possibility to escape or revolt. They are also known as the illuminati or occult etc. They have been a system consisting of people that has operated for decades and passed down through generations. Full control is the plot of their neverending game and can be traced through history in every avenue of life. Wherever they can strengthen their hold, they will do it or try to do it. They are evil and they will stop at nothing.

Trump and Roy Cohn orchestrated the assassination of JFK with their mafia pals who were pissed at JFK for trying to expose them. Russia was also secretly on the side of Trump and his secret society of elites. Cuba (Castro) had revolted against the mafia and CIA takeover of their country. CIA convinced JFK to try to secretly invade them (bay of pigs)....after JFK called it off he had pissed off this evil secret society.....they then told Russia (fake enemy of these evil american elites) to help out cuba to defend themselves which began the Cuban missile crisis. This would set the stage for JFK's eventual assassination by the mafia (aligned with Trump/Cohn and their illuminati people) who were upset at JFK's brother trying to bring them to justice. They wanted it to seem like JFK caused possible nuclear warfare by halting the invasion of Cuba. Meanwhile Cuba/Castro had no idea that Russia was using them in this chess game as a fake ally......

You can see later in history as Trump celebrates the death of Castro, a man who was protecting his country from the evil illuminati invasion 

This is part 1 of many chapters I have researched for years on this subject.

Part 2 will be how Trump/Giuliani/ and the Saudi Royals who lived in Trump Tower orchestrated 9/11

Part 3 will be how Alex Jones/Roger Stone/Paul Manafort/Donald Trump invented PACs decades ago in order to take over the political system and eventually got Alex Jones to create his own conspiracy channel where he makes conspiracy theorists look like crazy people who should be shunned while at the same time pushing the narrative of the new world order and indoctrinating people into their evil game",conspiracy,1535074748,PussyRiot2016,22,1,True,2018-08-23

I'm positive everyone who clicks on this has at least heard of the term before, you just didn't remember what it meant, but you were smart enough to recognize it. The government doesn't put it on billboards and all that because then some people might have realized the truth all along. They throw the idea of aliens at us so we can play with it like babies who they think could never accept the truth (hence why it's said to be a conspiracy theory: because a lot of people don't believe in it...even though it's true). They don't want us to know the truth about the anthropocene because then we would simply accept aliens as fact and they would lose another marketing trick. We need to make the true anthropocene more known, that aliens are destroying Mars and they need help. They are a race falling apart and they're trying to get help from someone but out government is blocking it out and using the idea of it to sell to us.

350,Matching Serial Numbers - The truth about Ambassador Stevens In Benghazi,"Matching serial numbers...

So here's the REAL story. Ambassador Stevens was sent to Benghazi in order to retrieve US made Stinger Missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia WITHOUT Congressional oversight or permission.
 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brokered the deal through Ambassador Stevens and a Private Arms Dealer named Marc Turi.  Then some of the shoulder fired Stinger Missiles ended up in Afghanistan and were used against our own military.

It was July 25th, 2012 when a US Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stinger Missiles.  But because the idiot Taliban didn't arm the Stinger Missile the US Chinook helicopter didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile.  That led back to a cache of Stinger Missiles being kept in Qatar by the CIA.

Obama and Hillary were now in FULL panic mode; so Ambassador Stevens was sent back to Benghazi to retrieve the rest of the Stinger Missiles. This was a ""do-or-die"" mission, which explains the Stand Down Orders given to multiple commando teams.  It was the State Dept, NOT the CIA, that supplied the Stinger Missiles to our sworn enemies, because Gen. Petraeus wouldn't approve supplying these deadly missile weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft.

Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a YouTube video.

This is what the investigation is all about, why she had a Private Server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and WHY Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was the result of a YouTube video, even though everyone KNEW it was not.

Further...the Taliban KNEW that this administration aided and abetted the enemy WITHOUT Congressional oversight or permission when Boehner created the Select Cmte; so the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of five Taliban Generals.  Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn.

So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised and a woman that is a serial liar, who PERJURED herself multiple times at Congressional Hearings.

Perhaps this is why NO military aircraft were called in because the administration KNEW our enemies had Stinger Missiles.

352,What is the Deep State? How bout we put it in terms of Obama's Presidency....,"&gt;Why did  the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the same?  Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: **Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Though it’s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice, much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book,  “National Security and Double Government,” **he catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability, transparency, or checks and balances  of any kind.** He uses the term **“double government”:** There’s **the one we elect, and then there’s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked.** Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Glennon cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or  the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added 30,000 more troops.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, he is the quintessential insider: He was legal counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a consultant to various congressional committees, as well as to the State Department. “National Security and Double Government” comes favorably blurbed by former  members of the Defense Department, State Department, White House, and even the CIA. And he’s not a conspiracy theorist: Rather, **he sees the  problem as one of “smart, hard-working, public-spirited people acting in  good faith who are responding to systemic incentives”—without any  meaningful oversight to rein them in.** [https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/18/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL/story.html](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/18/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL/story.html)

356,"I wrote this for a post that is a few days old, but thought it might deserve its own post... A Taste of the Truth Behind Charles Manson from Someone That Was There."," I'm gonna preface this all by saying that a lot of what I'm gonna talk about originally came from my own research into various aspects of this stuff. A few years after I went through my ""Charlie"" phase I happened to coincidentally get to know a person that was directly involved with a lot of this stuff. Most of what I am saying comes from someone that was there. I will not say who this person is (it's highly unlikely anyone would know of him anyway), but I have definitely seen enough proof from photos and documents to know this person is definitely telling the truth about his involvement in these circles. He was approached by documentary filmmakers a few years ago who wanted to pay him for these photos and documents (seen proof of that too) and he wouldn't give the stuff to them, so I'm not going to betray his trust. He also just passed away earlier this year, so it would be just rude to go against his wishes. Enough digging could probably identify him if you put in the legwork though.

Much of what Manson did was straight out of the ""how to be a cult leader"" playbook. But, I would suggest that he didn't break any of ""his people"" down. 

He didn't destroy people's beliefs and replace them with his own. I think what's closer to the reality is that he spoke of things that they already believed. He was undoubtedly highly charismatic and he simply said and did things that people vibed with.

As he puts it himself: he was a music man, rode a motorcycle and did whatever he wanted, without the constraints of society. That appealed to and inspired a lot of people. That's just one of the reasons he attracted so many famous and ""known"" people. His music group The Family Jams (where the MSM ideas of ""The Family"" comes from) was very popular in L.A. at the time. They we're wanted at all the parties. Not just for the music they brought, but also the fun.

He was also a very small guy, yet commanded a great deal of respected and projected confidence and power everywhere he went..... People are inspired by the underdogs taking powerful positions.

Manson also ALWAYS spoke in riddles. This had the effect of literally mesmerizing people. Just like with Qanon, if you speak in riddles people can hear what they want to hear.

As far as the CIA connection goes, there is one, but it's indirect and the truth of it speaks more to the other things that were going on at the time that influenced Manson and not the other way around. 

When Manson got out of prison in '67 he made his way to San Francisco. While in San Francisco he met Patricia Krenwinkel and Susan Atkins. Both of those girls, but especially Susan AKA Sadie were very involved in the San Francisco/ California underworld.

Right around the same time Al Hubbard AKA Captain Trips was running an operation in San Francisco for the CIA. In this operation he was tasked with finding prostitutes who would take johns to certain locations and unwittingly dose the johns with LSD. This was part of the LSD/MK ULTRA experiments. Sadie was one of the prostitutes that were recruited for this work. She got a kick out of it. And also got an almost unlimited supply of LSD for it.

It's important to realize that at this time with the CIA experiments into LSD that a lot of the players had legit street cred in the underworld. Al Hubbard was highly respected and was actually one of the godfathers of LSD. He was genuinely interested in LSD for his own personal interest and is known as the Johnny Appleseed of LSD. He was literally the first source of LSD for most people in the country. The CIA knew this about him and recruited him for the San Francisco op based on this. He obliged as he had some close friends in the agency. His involvement with LSD and the underworld precluded his involvement with the agency....maybe

So, Sadie was one of his prostitutes and Al Hubbard also happened to be one of the best known figures in the underworld around the nation. That's pretty much the extent of any actual somewhat direct connection to the agency and Manson.

But wait, there's more!

Sadie was quite close to the legit occult community in San Francisco. I'm not talking about Anton Lavey, he was considered a poser. I'm talking about the Kenneth Anger crowd. Kenneth Anger was one of the most well-known and respected American occultists at the time and that group did not fuck around when it came to just about anything. This is the connection my source has. He was in that circle and happened to live caddy corner to the Kenneth Anger house at Alamo Square. Angers house was the old Russian Consulate building. Both Sadie and Bobby Beausoleil were very close to Anger. Sadie appeared in his film Lucifer Rising and Beausoleil did the music for it. Beausoleil was also Angers lover for a minute.

Now, a lot of people want to make the connection to Manson and the Process Church of the Final Judgment saying that the Process Church is what got him into the violent stuff. But, when the first people from The Process came to San Francisco in mid '67 they got hooked up with the crowd at Alamo Square (the park that Angers house was adjacent to) and that's where *they* learned the violent stuff. It fit in perfectly with the experiences they just had while in Mexico where they faced terrible conditions trying to set up a community there. They went't through a lot of pain and struggle in Mexico mainly associated with a hurricane that hit.

ok ok, I could and maybe should write a book about this, but I'll spare you for now.

Basically, there was a lot of violence at that time in San Francisco. There was a motorcycle club called the Straight Satan's that ran the weed and lsd being sold at Alamo Square. They were hippies though and were part of the ""cool"" underworld. Alamo Square and the country in general starting seeing an influx of heroin. They, along with the locals that lived at the square were opposed to this and they banded together with the locals (this included Angers crowd) to stop the sale of heroin in the area. It started as fist fights with heroin dealers, turned into locals keeping 24/7 watch on the park and eventually, a couple of murders happened.

The violence was exclusively between dealers and the Straight Satan's until one of the local hippies ended up stabbing a heroin dealer to death. This guy was kind of part of Kenneth Angers circle. And this is where it took off.

The Kenneth Anger crowd were known for pushing the boundaries of occult practices and rituals. By this time they had begun experimenting with blood letting. The act of drawing blood in magical workings. Up until this point they had only been using their own blood or at least the blood of people willing to take part. After the hippie guy committed the murder he came and told everyone about the rush he got from it, the transcendental experience it triggered in him. This got them all curious and it was all down hill from there.

Now, I am certainly not saying that Kenneth Anger took part in any of this, but some of his friends did.

Like I said before: this is right around the time that the early group of people from The Process came into town and they were there when all this was going down. This is where they got their inspiration for violence. If you know about David Berkowitz and all that stuff, you know what I'm talking about. The stories of The Process sacrificing Alsatian dogs at this time were the beginnings of their experimentation with this.

Really long story made sort of short: This led to The Process and other people in that circle becoming known as blood letters and eventually the blood-letting became almost a party trick. This eventually led to rich party goers wanting in on the action and they began to hire *certain people* to perform this act for them. Sometimes at ""events"". Kill someone as part of your ritual and you add a ton of power to said ritual. This is the Roman Polanski connection.

Polanski wanted that performed at a party and tried to hire Manson for it. Manson was not on board with all that shit, was pissed off because he felt betrayed by the Hollywood types and what happened happened. *""You want me to kill for your entertainment? Well, here. How's this?""*

The book serves as a warning to the materialistic aristocracy of 19th century French society and warns of their fall from grace and power.

# Family of Secrets - A Worthwhile Read

I have been reading book excerpts and watching videos by Investigative Journalist **Russ Baker** (he is a Mainstream Reporter and not some fringe guy if that is what your assuming.)

[Family of Secrets: The Bush Dynasty, America's Invisible Government, and the Hidden History of the Last Fifty Years](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608190064/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) (Published 2009.) 

Youtube also has a number of Book Review type interviews with Russ Baker that are interesting.

In any event, the Book provides some very interesting context to some seemingly unrelated events by examining the whereabouts, motivations, history, friends and abilities of **George HW Bush (""Poppy"").**

**For example, how did JFK and 3 future Presidents all end up in Dallas on the same day, especially Nixon and presumably Bush?**

**Nixon apparently left Dallas early in the morning of Nov. 22 and was in the air when Kennedy was killed.** He found out when he landed and as one can imagine, Nixon was very disturbed that he was in the same city as his supposed political ""nemesis"". Those are some bad optics, if nothing else.

It is interesting how Nixon ended up in Dallas that day though. He was invited several weeks earlier at the behest of a friend and **Pepsi** Executive Donald Kendall. **In addition to being close to Nixon, Kendall seems to have had some pretty close ties to the Bush family.** 

&gt;*Kendall was a close friend of the Bush family and a fellow resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1988, he would serve in the crucial position of finance chairman for Poppy Bush’s successful run for the presidency.*  

So much has been written about the Kennedy assassination that the book's dive into the JFK conspiracy might be interesting, but not necessarily completely stacked with new revelations. *(It's very interesting how Johnson ended up in Dallas, too.)*

# Watergate

**The information about Watergate was much more intriguing and it really makes one wonder about the Bush Dynasty, especially ""Poppy.""**

To keep this short, Poppy seems to have been more intimately involved in pushing the Watergate story, and Nixon's eventual resignation, as a member of Nixon's administration. You can start to conclude that **not only did Poppy have a hand in JFK's death, but also setting up Nixon** (an already paranoid type) to take the fall for the Watergate Burglaries that seem to have been set up by Poppy himself.

Moreover, if Poppy really did take down both **JFK and RMN**, the assassination attempt on **Ronald Reagan** in 1980 seems more suspicious than what the history books have always reported or coincidences that have long been swept under the rug. 

**Finally, since Reagan lived, the Iran Contra scandal is worth another look in the context of Poppy's proclivity to make President's go away.**

government, please make a magnetosphere using halfwave emissions in a satellite grid, plus another satellite grid could be made around Mars which would help with restarting Mars's biosphere too. emit halfwaves from 2 halfwave emission circuits using timings in a way that would look like this; figure magnetic field charges instead of electrical charges:_-_-_-_-_-_ (all (-) charges, it just uses 2 alternating emission sources on each satellite, hence the term halfwave instead of fullwave)

this should keep a constant magnetic field, just make sure that hackers can't turn it off by keeping it manually maintained and repaired instead of remotely and don't forget that people gave up on society before the whole religious takeover thing during the middle ages. account for human error for the sake of keeping everyone safe, just in case. people tend to act out their intentions and even their counter intentions, which works by people being forgetful while thinking consciously or subconsciously of their actions which ends up in mistakes and in misfortune sometimes. the countering thoughts sometimes contradict each other which might make them change their minds by remembering to see signs where they just don't relate to each other.

But the parallels between the stories and the overwhelming number of them raises eyebrows. It's worth at least checking out sometime; we live in a genuinely very mysterious world.

424,What The Hell Is Going On? (Part one),"Where are we now?
If you've been paying much attention to the world of late, you may have noticed that things have gotten pretty bad. Regardless of what we are referring to specifically – the state of the world, the human condition, the potential of our future as a race of beings – everything seems to be in quite the state of chaos and disarray. The human animal seems to be rapidly changing, but the term evolving does not feel appropriate to describe any of the changes. The structures and institutions in our societies no longer serve the functions of the populous, but function structurally upon the populous, changing humanity into what we are witnessing right now. These changes we are undergoing as a species are phenomenal, and on some levels unprecedented in human history. On other levels, what we are witnessing is resultant of the continuation of structures and control methods that have been in place for literally thousands of years; the final bricks of the pyramid being put into place.
Humanity's rich history of recording our representations in paintings and sculptures betray a clear missing link between humanity's past and future in the character of Homer Simpson. Before the appearance of Homer Simpson in 1987, there are simply no representations of the contemporary Western human male form. Even what has been now termed male pattern baldnesscan only be found sporadically in representation before the early nineteenth century, and seemingly confined to certain genealogies. While it may be argued that the invention of the camera around this time may account for more ""honesty"" in representations of the human male form than may have resulted from technologies with which idealisation of the form is more readily accomplished (as with sculpture and painting), it must also be noted that this period also coincides with the period of industrialisation that saw massive change in the way that humans lived, and with the introduction of regular exposure to chemicals and conditions created by industrialisation itself.
Prior to the introduction of Homer Simpson in 1987, the history of our art shows no representations of the form of the contemporary Western human male as we have come to know it today: the effeminised bowling pin silhouette with wider hips than shoulders, breasts that would excite any pubescent boy, and a body, hormonally, that is preparing for menopause. It would appear, in this instance, that life certainly imitates art, though, as Homer Simpson has provided the archetype which a large portion of the population have allowed themselves to be molded. This illustrates the next two important concepts we will be addressing: archetypes and consent.  
Archetypes and Categories  
Human beings are inescapably categorical thinkers, and most disagreement that occurs between humans is of the categorical variety. The larger the category being discussed, the greater the opportunity for disagreement. A consummate example of this may be found in positions taken in regard to religion and theology, whereby those who agree on the definitions of a larger category are allowed the freedom within that category of maintaining disputes regarding smaller subcategories, and to maintain those disputes without animosity. Conversely, those of opposing positions regarding the larger categories of faith will have no opportunity to even consider the smaller categories from cross positions, as witnessed in every single religious dispute throughout human history.
Further, categorical thinking is essentially relational, and lends itself naturally toward a substitutive or algebraic logic which then tends to be the underlying pattern for human cognition and the structuring of relations. This is the process through which metaphor gains its gargantuan power to influence our realities, both conceptually and actually. Metaphors, while linguistic in qualia, derive their systematic rationale not through language itself (through the literal definitions of the terms employed by the metaphor used), but through embodied experience and the cognition of that embodied experience, with almost all language we employ accoutered by metaphors of human embodiment and activity. Metaphor is not a matter of words, but of concepts drawn directly from lived experience. Metaphors function by partially structuring one experience in terms of another, in effort to structure abstract or personal experiences in terms of more concrete or communally shared ones. Metaphors function far beyond linguistic expression and instead structure and influence the human conceptual system; constituting our worldviews, and resonating both our personal subjectivity and our shared conceptions of human experience as humans. Metaphors are entirely conceptual, and are structured, and function, through conceptual inference. Metaphors allow us to use what we know about our experience with the world subjectively as a (metaphoric) tool for drawing inferences in other domains that are less concrete and not grounded in direct, communicably accessible experiences (love, life, justice, etc.).
And metaphors are entirely categorical. Algebraic or substitutive reasoning is the uninfluenced form taken within categorical thinking, and it has several flaws to its process that deserve consideration. Substitutive categorical reasoning is alwaystrapped within the confines of its own paradigm – and without antithetical propositions it is simply blind to its own limitations or incoherencies. Without serious methodological adjustment, such categorical substitutive reasoning leads to a proliferation of what Donald Rumsfeld famously termed unknown unknowns. Within this cognitive and relational framework, the metaphors that will naturally be adopted will be those that reinforce the paradigm itself, further frustrating any attempts to interpret the world through any other possible framework.
Modern society relies intimately on these structural tendencies of human cognition, and goes all out to amplify this effect for the purposes for social control through division and conquer. One of the more powerful tools in their arsenal I like to call The Breakfast Club; the creation of predefined archetypes positioned throughout the kulture kreation komplex for members of society to simply choose between in the creation and formation of their own identities. Pre- early nineteenth century industrialisation, identity formation used to operate very differently for humans than it does today: people lived primarily within family units, which were then part of larger communities created and defined by weather, geography and praxis. Within such an environment, personal identities were formed in concert with others, and in response not simply to the daily patterns and customs of life, but in mistakes made. In such an environment, mistakes – social or otherwise – cannot be ignored, and instead function as the formative basis for personal identity formation.
As we know from the work of Lacan, the process of a human coming to understand themselves as an I among other I's is a drawn out process of discovery in stages. At first, the child's grasp of self extends to the breast, and it is some time before the child discovers that it is in fact separate from the breast, and from the mother. At some point there will be some small episode of lashing out against the mother (against the proper owner of the breast once thought to be a part of the child), though it will not be until the child is able to comprehend its own reflection (and possibly grasp the concept of the number four) that it will come to understand itself as an I among other I's. In pre-industrialised identity formation, we find further stages of cultural, social and personal development beyond the work of Lacan, in the creation of a socially shared communal rationality and culture.
Within family and local community environments, individuals are structurally obligated to continue this process of discovery in the formation of their own personal identities in concert with others, and in response to developmental challenges. In these processes, the daily routine of culture is less formative than instances of aberration against the culture and society, and it is through these social and cultural erratum that personalities are formed, rather than adopted in archetype. Individuals within these social environments would still look to others as archetypes in one sense, as children imitate their elders, but their conception of themselves (as an I among other I's) would be a socially sharedconstruct developed in conjunction with others, and through interaction with others. That mistakes are made, and are forgiven, is the underlying basis of human society and natural identity formation processes.
In contrast to this, we have seen, since the mid-twentieth century particularly, a drastic shift in the cultural and social processes of identity formation; a phenomenon which must be understood coextensively with the proliferation of new media technologies. We will be discussing these technologies extensively as we progress.  
Who are we?  
Who we are is everything. All of our thoughts, experiences, perceptions, aspirations, and actions – collective and specific, cultural and biological – follow from who we are. “Who am I?” is reliant for its bearings on “What are we?” The importance of this process of identity formation operates simultaneously in two directions; to the personal, and to the external, where representations accumulate and interact to become culture, with personal identity formation simultaneously structured within “cultures of representation”. Who we are is a function of what we are, and where we are. As “emergent phenomena within nature”nature provides the forms (if you will) for what culture seeks to become as a representation. Human culture, as a representative form, is embedded in the processes of being human; that is, from being born and perceiving the world (and existent culture) through the same five senses, learning representations and mistaking them, and learning from mistakes.
The task of culture – indeed, the possibility of it – arises from the coherency we find in nature, and our intrinsic understanding and acceptance of natural forms of semiosis and the processes of (our own) existence. Simply asking “How am I here?” relies, for every possible argument, on identifying natural, or pre-existent (pre-cultural) teleological semiosis. It is the coherency that can be found in natural forms of semiosis that set our representations and culture with the task of seeking coherency as we seek to define who we are. In the same way that a sunflower, by its actions becomes capable of reproducing another sunflower, and by its relationship to the sun in this process becomes a representamen of the sun, so too does culture, knowledge and the human project itself reproduce its own likeness and behaviours, effectively not only becoming a representamen of nature, but forming the interpretive and discursive sets through which signs may be taken and formed.
The relationship of effect between coherency and incoherency is vastly different in nature than in culture. Incoherencies open up possibilities for development (and from this, continuation) within culture specifically because it is never fully formed, and is reliant on adequate perceptions and interpretations. Nature, however, encounters incoherencies as stumps in progression, being already fully formed (and through this formation of systemics, invested with meaning). Cultural or not, as beings within this system, as “emergent phenomena within nature,” who we are, our conception of ourselves does not only influence our relationship with nature and the external – it is our relationship with the external, and our legitimacy within it. The process of personal identity formation (that is, localised instances) is informed by rites, mores, traditions and position-takings, all of which are resultant of stories – narratives – emergent from conglomerates of, and permutations between individuals and societies – different co-influential fields created and reinforced by shared experiences and perceptions. In this, culture can be seen as hereditary perceptual sets which influence and reinforce their own particularities through positive feedback loops of interpretation and explanation of experience.
We can see this played out in the history of science, where on many occasions throughout, true progress has been held back by predefined and reinforced perceptual and interpretive sets. The most glaring example comes from the influence of Aristotle whose ideas fundamentally hampered scientific progress for some two thousand years. A master logician, Aristotle’s teachings were all taken to be true, with the intellectual capital earned through logical argument in one field being equally attributed to all other fields which he wrote on the topics of. Not until close to two millennia later did Galileo challenge his ideas (risking his reputation in doing so) on such things as the effects of gravity on falling objects and the position of the earth as the centre of the universe. By the time he had conducted experiments dropping objects of varying mass from the Tower of Pisa, Galileo had already been expelled from the University of Pisa for questioning Aristotle’s authority on such matters. In human biology, Aristotle’s heart-centred view of physiology maintained dominance until the sixteenth century, holding that “the brain is an organ of minor importance, perhaps necessary to cool the blood.” In the field of botany, his views that plants were not divided into sexes dominated until the eighteenth century. While a contemporary of Aristotle, Democritus, put forward the position that matter was composed of tiny particles he termed atoms, this idea only surfaced again in the late seventeenth century due to the influence of Aristotle’s teachings.  
A new type of person  
New media technologies and the purposes they are put toward are contributing to the distortion of spatial and temporal referents, and their legitimacy. The advent of writing and alphabetic literacy functioned to drastically restructure consciousness, initiating new ways of thinking and remembering, list making, and fostered complex analytic thought. In a world of meaning dominated by sign systems, the phonetically representative system of signs led to the deification of the word, with authority anointed through left-justified formality. Written statements came to be a preferred method of record keeping, ending the tradition of pre-eminence given to witness accounts, and the verbal recounting of one’s ancestor’s account, a very specific history.
The change and development of media technologies have served to bring about change in the methods and systems of interpretation within humans. The justified print of the newspaper, with information contained to the very edge of its presence on the paper, had the effect of declaring through its systems of signs that it contained all the news, and was complete. New media technologies are having the effect of distorting the functions (and associated referents) of time and space, and are totally devoid of relationships of reference with the receiver (the relationship, for example, of an individual to the newspaper which s/he purchased). Whether consciously or unconsciously, the uses to which these emergent media technologies are put serve to replicate and reinforce the logic of consumer capitalism (and simultaneously, it must be noted, resist it).
To be human is to be situated already in our thinking and being within time; within timelines. The formation of personal identity, “biographical experience,” or “psychic life” is created (occurs) within chronological time and naratological unfolding, much like these sentences being written and read. The situatedness of human thinking by its very act contextualises itself. Narrative is not simply a progression of events, but also a story-teller and an audience to whom the story is told. But the nature of culture and personal identity formation operate in such a way that this discourse is occurring constantly and from many disparate positions. Historical narrative is told and conceptualized from within first the atomist position taking, then in its recounting is brought into the communal sphere of culture, where the natural functions of hermeneutic evolutions are corrupted and confounded by power relationships for cultural capital which can be gained through the manipulation of cultural dictates as a whole in a given direction.
The largest ramification of this is the creation of a new type of person being created by these emerging media technologies. Before 1944, there was no such thing as a Teenager. The entire categorical archetype was a creation of the media – which, from its inception has always been entirely under the control of government, and used to propagandise its own citizens and literally create their culture. The mid-1940's – much like the late 1980's – marks a rather incredible turning point for Western human culture in general, as this was when the Tavistock claws really tore into the flesh of human culture, creating the offerings of identity formation we witness today. In addition to generational categories whose sole purpose is to destabilise the family, we witness the introduction of personality archetypes, all cleverly designed to reinforce the culture being created in the manner we discussed earlier, in which metaphors that will naturally be adopted will be those that reinforce the paradigm itself, further frustrating any attempts to interpret the world through any other possible framework.  
The Breakfast Club  
In the 1980's, a guy called John Hughes started making movies that subtly introduced relationships of pederasty in an acceptable light, and continued the trend started in the 1950's of sexualising children for family audiences. One of his larger successes in culture creation came in the form of a movie from 1985 called The Breakfast Club, in which (IMDb) ""five high school students meet in Saturday detention and discover they have a lot more in common than they thought."" What was important about this movie, particularly, was the archetypes of the characters themselves; archetypes we have witnessed repeated literally fucking ad nauseum since. The jock, the princess, the brain, the weird kid, and the freak.
Now, it is not my interest to outright horrify you here, but if you look at the culture which surrounds you today, you will notice that every single positioned talking head falls into one of these categories. This is for a reason, and this is by design. And while I have been focusing on a narrative from the twentieth century, this is really little more than an extension of the idea of surnames, which were only introduced for taxation purposes, and were generally used to define the type of work you would do to benefit the state. This is why most surnames we have today refer to either some trade or physical characteristic genetically passed down and identifiable to tax collectors, or reference to a location where the family might be found, and taxes levied.
With the advent and proliferation of new media forms, we witness the emergence of a new type of person who has no idea who s/he is. Like Akira, this media has become ubiquitous in the lives of every citizen, and in most homes every chair faces the magic screen that is the largest propaganda arm of government. In so doing, it has wedged itself between every living person in society, and in between every relationship. The very understanding of the self has become entirely mediated by media to the degree that people no longer form their own identities in concert with others, but instead choose them, and try them on. Every single aspect of our culture is designed to reinforce this feedback loop, from fashion, to industrial design, to music, to cars, to laws, zoning and permissions given by the state. At every level of your interaction with your culture, you are expected to adhere to an appropriate archetype.
Further, these archetypes serve a purpose beyond just giving you a coke/pepsi selection to the uniform you choose to wear (all clothing is a uniform). These archetypes serve a very important function formatively upon the minds of people, while remaining completely interchangeable at all times. This is evident in all genre movies (movies, like music, are all entirely formulaic now, not a surprise considering where they really come from...); even within a jock movie, you will have these five archetypes represented within the group of jocks – it is an essential aspect of culture creation, to always have these predefined archetypes in some form as a means of influencing position-taking.
These archetypes function not only as uniforms to try on for the developing individual, as well as identities to aspire to, but as social conditioning and stratification tools and insinuated hierarchical relationships defined by the roles chosen. Through these position-takings, public sentiment can be defined and directed, and most importantly, discourse can be derailed at any time through division and conquer according to these categorical archetypes. As mentioned, these archetypes are dynamic and interchangeable, and what matters is not even so much which group one aspires to, but simply that they identify in some way with one of the archetypes offered, at least in part. These archetypes are reinforced through memetic culture to become the basis of your social interactions with others, particularly with the simultaneous liberalisation of culture where you have to accept each person for who they are in spite of the fact that people just try to exceed one another competitively as to who can be most archetypal (as seen quite easily in street gangs and prison culture, led by the nose by the media).
These archetypes function as useful tools of division, where literally any discussion can be derailed along these personalitylines and position-takings. ""As a single mum with a daughter, I am offended by..."" It is the primary role of the positioned talking headsto continually reinforce these points of division: to frustrate discourse and communication about ideas, and instead concentrate on these entirely fabricated categories we use to define ourselves in opposition to others, rather than in concert with them. As mentioned, this is also ubiquitous acrossarchetypes, with the same divisions being found also within any social group or structure, a result of life imitating art (or propaganda working).
One reason this works so well is the illusion of choice offered at all times within such a construct. In reality these are simply useful categories from a social engineering perspective, and the weighted percentage of each category can be carefully crafted through manipulation of culture, as evidenced in rap music and gangster/prison culture, to create whatever social strata is desired by the creators of that culture. But central to all of this is not only choice, but consent.  
Consenting adults  
These sound like two very simple and straightforward words, and used together is likely a term that you arrived at this discussion with your own definition of, your own understanding. The true definition of these words – both legally and ontologically – is instead rather startling. The law we are really subject to, the law of piracy and ultimately of Rome, defines us all as consenting adultsnot for the reasons of definition you may think regarding the interactions between two consenting adults. We are all, in fact, Homer Simpson: a dolt through definition of our consent. We are the poisoned slave breeders, too stupid to recognise our positions of servitude let alone do anything about it. Instead, we consent to everything. We allow losers to lead us, and to rule over us. There are no innocent bystanders in this; only consenting adults.
Each and every member of our society is either a dolt, a sellout, or an admixture of the two (a useful idiot such as those who populate the ranks of most bureaucracies). In every sphere and specialisation within our society and its structures, the ""experts"" in charge are either incredibly stupid, absolutely corrupt, or a combination of both.
In dentistry we have the very large problem of fluoride. Even a few hours spent practicing google-fu on the topic of fluoride would have any right-thinking individual questioning the prevalence of it in our drinking water and a vast range of pharmacology. There is really not even any valid arguments from the 'official position' side of the argument, which openly admits that fluoride is only beneficial to teeth in a very small developmental window, and even then only when applied topically (not ingested). So why do 'four out of five dentists recommend...'? Dentists, being those invested with social capital as 'experts' in their specialisation, you would think, would be among the most informed on the topic of fluoride in our society, and they tell us it is fine, drink the fucking water. And they are paid handsomely to do so. And after five or six years of college (with or without debt) and a manicured hand that feeds, who would be tempted to rock that luxury yacht?
Similar with doctors, who function not as healers, but as the point-of-sale merchants for corporate pharma. We see evidenced in such things as the DSM broadening definitions of official maladies to the point that suggests that everyone should in some way be medicated. While this obviously plays to the interests of big pharma, it is the absolute responsibility of those who have taken an oath to do no harm to police their own specialisation. But, again, who would rock that boat? When elevated to one of these positions of societal prominence by a structure, why would you personally undermine the foundations of that structure by raising pertinent questions?
And so it goes with lawyers and judges, each of whom quickly learns the corruption within our legal systems, and happily dons the priestly robes of that class to maintain the corrupt system, as beneficiaries. It is the responsibility of the individuals in these roles to do more than play the part assigned to them, but the system is maintained precisely by the acquiescence of each individual to accept their role in the litany of lies, rather than to speak out against or question that system and the roles they play within it. Our very democracy is proposed as the system which reflects and serves the will of the majority, and plainly such is not the case. Our democratic systems themselves have been constructed and designed in such a way as to prohibit the will of the people from influencing their own governance. And if the rabble get raucous? Some violence and lies will soon get them thanking their jailers and locking themselves back in their chosen cells.
And the system exists as it does precisely because we accept it as such. We allow laws to be passed which serve the interests of no person or citizen of the state. We allow the continuance of a system of selection rather than election of our so-called 'leaders' who openly support the corporate person over the actual (cattle). We support this pyramid, each and every one of us. Even the laws of physics are taken to be variable since 91101, and for some reason many people just accept that. Time and again, complete fabrications have been the basis of virtually every change in human society: WMDs, Saddam, Muammar Al Qaddafi, Children Overboard... and that is not even mentioning any of the lies that have not been openly admitted to already, but have been uncovered nonetheless.
We allow this to happen. We not only let them lead us, we put on our own collars and hand them the lead. We do so by joining their conversations, rather than starting our own. Impossible physics are just that: impossible, and we should accept no person of learning who puts forward any explanations for anything which relies on impossible physics for their explanations. Nor should we accept the explanation of incompetence and stupidity always offered in place of admission of the true extent of corruption in all of these cultural and societal structures. 'Bad intelligence' cannot be accepted as an explanation for carefully orchestrated deceptions. And if we are to accept that all of our selected leaders are in fact so incompetent and stupid as they are often shown to be to scapegoat the reality of the orchestration, then how in the fuck have these dregs of humanity made it into the positions of authority they have attained?
They have made it into those positions through our consent. We allow this to happen, and support the pyramid on top of us with every consensual rape we submit to daily. There are no innocent bystanders, we are each and every one guilty of our subservience to the systems that we know intuitively function only to enslave us.
So that is where we are now (well, part one anyway); part two will go into more specifics about how we are controlled through poisoning; semiotic and biological.

437,The Money Mistake,"
**The Money Mistake.**  
I will begin by stating that it is my position that money is not simply an evil (though the love of it is certainly the final cause of many evils we encounter), but an entirely flawed metaphor that has no place in human development. Money emerges (as do many other things) out of the flawed metaphor of ownership, which functionally has no place in a healthy human system. No one ever owns anything ever, and every individual death in human history attests to this absolute and undeniable fact of existence. We, as human beings, are custodial caretakers of existence, here to make and do: here to improve upon the world we find ourselves in, not to consume it, not to own it.  

We have been lied to about a great many things, and have been structurally separated from the natural world from which we are natural emergents. Food is only as scarce as our human systems and structures dictate. All resources are made scarce by design: aside from electric vehicles, all of our cars could be running on biodiesel made from hemp, while driving on roads made from hemp and mushrooms (roads that repair themselves), with every single dwelling supported by a host of free energy sources, stored using very small amounts of thorium in pressure vessels a few feet below the steps of every home. All of this is possible using fundamentals I can prove and even display for you myself (not to mention on-demand hydrogen, and a host of other things), fundamentals which are kept from us through the course of our indoctrinations, kept sacred by robed priests (whores paid shut-up-monies, all of them) of academia and scientism.  

We have been lied to about the purpose of money, for instance. Money is a hex for your intentions. Through the employment of money, your intention is directed away from what it should be focussed on, and is instead directed toward this symbol (it is literal sigil magic) and all of that intention of yours is instead directed to the makers of the symbol. Human beings are magic fucking creatures and we have the power within us to quite literally influence and shape reality all through our intention. You see, then, how getting everyone to misuse and squander that intention is important to them.
But money is also less than this: money is mistakes. And its function as and substitution for mistakes is only amplified as it increases volumetrically (each ""point"" is worth slightly more than the previous in regards to mistakes). Think of it first on the small scale: an individual working minimum wage budgets pretty tightly, brings lunch to work most days, but treats herself every Friday to a bought lunch from one of the local eateries. As she has little ""spare"" money in her possession, she has very little room for errorin her selection, and she is likely to shop with prudence, and not very likely to take chances on something unfamiliar. Because she has very little money, she has very little room for mistake in how she spends it; she can't buy her way out of the mistake of buying a crappy overpriced lunch.
The same might be applied to any purchase, from small daily exchanges to the acquisition of a mortgage. The more money you have, the less your mistakes with it matter. If you buy a lemon, you may be able to afford to have it fixed, or even just replace it. The same is true of the concept of warranty, whereby you pay for peace of mind, and are in effect betting against the manufacturer (which is good practice – planned obsolescence is at the heart of all modern manufacturing, I have stories!), knowing full well they have designed your product to break after a certain period of time.  

We have all witnessed just how much you can fuck up and still buy your way out of it, to the degree that I am just too spoiled for choice for examples to even begin listing them! Money is a representative value, but the value it actually represents is the negative value of mistakes.
This actually has a double edged sword effect in how it manifests in the behaviour and application of logic (not to mention stoicism) of the people it creates within such a system. I know some pretty well-off people, and outside of their specialty, I would never take advice from them, even on where to buy lunch. On the other hand, the folks that I worked with while doing waste management had some startlingly good advice on many topics I had not even put thought toward before meeting them. They always knew the best (and best value) places to get lunch, wherever we were across the city, and none of them were in the habit of making mistakes, generally. They had never been in a position to be able to afford mistakes, and regardless of their stations in life, they had learnedhow not to make so many mistakes.  

The same can be said for businesses and governments, in that their largess allows them to fuck up as much as they like (if they can afford it, or better yet, get someone else to pay).
Living where I do (remote), I have to learn to make use of everything I have, to waste as little as possible. Money is of little use to me here mostly, as the only thing to buy within our larger area is bags of horse poo for a dollar a bag, and if I need to get a tree down and cut up, money isn't going to fucking help, now, is it? My garden provides food not from some sort of return on investment (I built the gardens out of other peoples' rubbish, manufactured my own soil, planted my own seeds and seeds and plants given to me by friends), but from my ongoing attention (intention). Out here, money is not going to buy you out of your mistakes.  

The value of money is entirely fictional: it is a figment of the collective imagination. To many people, money is needed for making mistakes. Others don't have the luxury of mistakes, and become greater people for it. Money is only worth what you believe it is, and what it is worth to you. The value you place on money largely defines the value the monetary system places on you (and for many the value they place on themselves accordingly). To me, a dollar is worth exactly a bag of shit, and the horses on the property make that shit for free so why would I ever need that hell money?

449,Van Allen belts and Moon landing second question,"Hi

Thx for all the answers to my previous question regarding Van Allen belts and Moon landing.

The question was 'have we have went through the van allen belts after moon landing, if not, why aren't we?'

And the answers were like below.

\-we never tried after the moon landing.

\-van allen belt is not impossible to travel, just dense with radiations

\-radiation particles in van allen belts are easy to block with aluminum or even paper, unlike things from nuclear reactor which need thick lead to block.

\-But long term journey through van allen belts to Mars or something would tax the astronaut's body.

\-There's no reason to try travelling through van allen belts again because Moon is a useless rock and we don't have money and terraforming Mars is not urgent matter.

....were those answers. And I appreciate all the replies.

But here are some more things I'm curious.

1. If those radiation particles are easy to block with aluminium and thin paper, why can't we build a spaceship which can block radiations for long term journey?

2. How do we know Moon is a useless rock? Did NASA thoroughly investigate the moon inside and out? Have we ever drilled the moon's surface?

3. Mars terraforming is not that far future problem. Earth is dying from pollution and climate change and all the trashes we are throwing away. We need to prepare terraforming other planet from now on, Scientists are scared of that the last stubborn iceberg finally has melted. We should study how to go through van allen belts without much damage to our body, from now on. Don't you think so?

4. So....how come we never tried to travel through van allen belts since the moon landing? I know we don't have money, but we have money to spend on CERN(which I don't know what the heck they are doing), and on so many military weapons, and if we can find useful minerals on the moon, the money would be compensated.

5. I still don't understand why don't we (or can't we) ever travel through van allen belts yet. Anyone care for reply? ",conspiracy,1535131517,Reignoffire9,45,19,True,2018-08-24

485,"John McCain, war hero or war criminal.","As the United States runs news stories on John McCain discontinuing treatment for his brain tumor and lauding him as a war hero there are some who feel different.

The following are excerpts from the events the day he was shot down over Hanoi:

""On that gray morning more than 32 years ago, McCain was knocked unconscious briefly when he ejected from his damaged bomber. Both his arms were broken, his right knee was shattered, and when he splashed into the middle of Truc Bach (White Silk) Lake, his 50 pounds of flight gear kept him from reaching the surface.

When Mai Van On finally got to him, about 200 yards out, all the older man could see was a bit of white silk, the top of the American’s parachute.

With U.S. planes still bombing and strafing their target of the day—a nearby light-bulb factory where On worked as a security guard—On used a stout bamboo pole to hoist McCain off the bottom of the lake.

“If I had hesitated even one more minute, I’m sure he would have died,” said On, still vigorous at 83 and still living in the same spot on the southern edge of the lake in the heart of downtown Hanoi.

“John McCain was lucky that morning,” On said. “It was about 11 a.m. I had just come home for lunch and put my bicycle into the house. Then the air-raid siren went off, and 60 or 70 of us ran to a tunnel to avoid the bombs. I was at the entrance to the tunnel when I saw the pilot go into the water.

“The tunnel was still shaking from the bombing when I ran to the lake.”

494,Artificial Intelligence - Alex Jones predicts future,"So a couple months ago I watched this Joe Rogan podcast with Alex Jones. They talk about some hectic shit and I agree with a lot of the stuff Alex Jones says, even if some of it sounds a bit far off.

In this podcast there is a part where Alex tells Joe about how the Elite/illuminati/whateverthefuck, the top 1%, are trying to get to higher dimensions and use Artificial Intelligence to read massive amounts of data and use that to predict the future. By predicting the future they can manipulate it and manipulate the future of humankind and take control of our lives. Alex says (in the podcast) in the coming future Google is going to become this huge AI that has all this massive amounts of information and they're going to use that to create some kind of higher dimension/higher level of consciousness and form a break away civilization. The Google AI is going to simulate a human brain and have a live neural network like a human brain. The massive Google AI is going to have live neurons in the brain like a human, and those live neurons is going to be billions of people feeding constant data and info to this Google AI. Keep in mind this podcast was streamed over a year ago, and it seems everything is coming true. If you check AI news on Google News, there is shit everywhere about how AI is already so advanced and being integrated in to EVERYTHING. All of a sudden Google puts a AI in charge of their DataCenters, probably the points in the world where the most amount of data and info travels through. I read about how the new way the create AI is with it to simulate a human brain and they use a ""neural network"". 
Also read about how the Chinese goverment or some other asian country wants to put up CCTV cameras all over the country, have an AI monitor it 24/7 and constantly scan people and their faces, and how the AI is going to use the raw data of scanning millions of people constantly, they're going to use that info the AI collects to predict criminals before they perform the crime.
It's all so insane to me, a year ago Alex Jones predicted all of this crap, and it's literally coming true all around us.

I read the article about the CCTV cameras about a month ago, the month of August, all of a sudden there are CCTV cameras being put up all around my town, and it's a small underdeveloped town so you wouldn't expect it.
I mean wtf?!?!?!

You see, in order for that person to actually change to the gender that they ""feel"" themselves being they solely rely entirely on modern technology to do the heavy lifting, per se.  Without technology and modern medicine, the gender trapped individual would have no other recourse than to maintain the organic relationship that that person was born to.  How incredible to think that each and every transgendered person that has transitioned is a modern day intellectual property, an invention. Literally manmade.

45,Looking for an alternative to this subreddit,"I don't intend to break a rule by saying this place is not suited for someone genuinely interested in conspiracy discussion. It's extremely opinionated, political, unrelated to conspiracy, and scatterbrained. The genuine conspiracy discussion here seems manufactured to be vapid and rehashed. 

I've seen conspiracyii, and it's no better a forum. If reddit is no longer the place for conspiracy discussion, sobeit, please direct me elsewhere. 

If a moderator comes through, I'd like to know if you rely more on user voting or user reports to filter the inevitable troves of rule-breaking content. I should use another phrase, perhaps, because there isn't actually a rule that says you have to discuss conspiracies here. The closest rule is #11, which seems very lightly enforced on a typical hot page cycle. I ask because there doesn't seem to be a method beyond user voting, which is part of the manufacturing process that's been going on here for quite some time. If there is some criteria or ""limit"" to literal political discussion or baseless theory sharing, I'd like to know what that is! 

I'm one of many that feel this way, I'm sure. It's just not easy to speak up about it without becoming aggressive toward the sub users and moderators. I offer no actual criticisms here beyond my opinion of the off-topic nature of the subreddit. This is part of a meta conspiracy -- the subreddit being controlled by disingenuous and dastardly entities. For users who have been consumed by this control, it may be impossible to notice. For users who have been baffled by this control, it is blindingly obvious. To elaborate, posts, comments, upvotes, downvotes, and content are not being organically/naturally introduced into the subreddit. I see the word shill and troll used here a lot, but those are not words I would use to describe these entities. The nature of the deconstruction of conspiracy is based in cognitive manipulations. These manipulations ARE used by corporations, which a shill would accurately represent, however, the manipulations here are rooted in free thinking and eye-opening. 

I digress into the meta conspiracy -- one curious will understand in time. The true purpose of this post is my own curiosity of other conspiracy subs that have not been targeted yet. Thank you for your time. I wish you all the best in your own free-think journey.

50,Goodyear and Bridgestone/Firestone,"I have worked in and around the tire industry since 1994. I worked for Goodyear and Bridgestone/Firestone. I will keep this as short as possible.

In the early the late 1980s and early 1990s the technology in tires rapidly changed. Tires went from from requiring tubes to tubeless, they also went from bias play to steel belted radials. Vulcanizing processes and the chemical compounds in rubber drastically changed. 

In the early 1990s tires had a mileage warranties. These warranties guaranteed a certain amount of miles out of a tire. Having guarantees of 100,000 miles or more was common.

In the 1990s Bridgestone/Firestone implemented a recall on tires due to rollovers with Ford Explorers. The tires were the Wilderness AT, ATX, and ATXII. I worked for Bridgestone during this time period in a position of authority.

The issue with the ATX was not that it was a bad tire. The issue was that it was an exceptionally well made tire. Sound ridiculous? Let me explain. 

The ATX tire would not wear out. I have seen thousands upon thousands of tires, defective tires, damaged tires. I am a trained accident investigator. I handled claims for tires. The ATX was an outlier as far as wear was concerned. These tires could last for over 200,000 miles given the right conditions. The average vehicle life cycle is about 250,000 miles. 

The issue was that nail or foreign object punctures in these tires. If an ATX was punctured then it would be repaired with a tire patch. This was pre-plug-patch. They would simply patch the tire internally. What happened is that moisture would get into the belting area. Because these tires lasted so long they would start to breakdown internally from moisture. Steel belts would rust and eventually break. The Ford Explorer had a high center of gravity. When a steel belt would break the driver would get a surprising jolt. There was a secondary issue that Ford recommended iirc 26 psi as the air pressure setting in these tires. Most tires at the time were 32 psi. Ford recommended 26 because of the high center of gravity, the Explorer would transmit more road vibration and have less responsive steering. The issue is that tires are susceptible to heat build up. Nylon uses heat to contract a tire and keep its shape. A steel bead provides support. Steel Belt gives it structure. Glue keeps it all together. Compare a steel beed to a house foundation, steel belts to the framing, nylon to the roof, and glue as the nails. Add in excessive heat and everything except the beed starts coming apart in a tire. Lower air pressure meant that more heat was retained. 

A steel belt rust and breaks. The tire heats up quickly. Everything comes apart. A sudden loss of air pressure occurs. The driver hears an explosion. The vehicle shifts. The driver gets scared and jerks the wheel and over compensates. The high center of gravity vehicle rolls over. People die. 

The ATX was a tire that could in theory last almost as long as the life cycle of a vehicle. It was almost a “lifetime tire”.

In the mid 1990s every tire manufacturer had the technology to make a “lifetime tire”. However, that would have radically changed the tire industry and possibly closed the big companies like Goodyear, Bridgestone/Firestone, and Michelin. These companies had huge investments in plants, rubber farms, and warehousing. Firestone for example had bought into countries like Liberia to lease rubber farms by building hospitals and infrastructure there. They also had the benefit of child labor. 

That lifetime technology never saw the light of day. Instead resources went into performance tires. In the mid 1990s there was a shift to 17,19,20 and 22 inch wheels. 13s,14s,15, and 16s were all but eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers partnered with the tire companies. After all a car manufacturer wants you to have a “wow” experience when you test drive a new car.

In the late 1990s even Toyota Corollas had performance tires. An H speed rating became almost the minimum at 130 mph. 

What this allowed tire manufacturers to do is to throw development dollars at performance technology instead of safety and longevity. Performance increased and longevity decreased. Over the next two decades tires lasted less time and were capable of exceeding a vehicles designed performance functions. Tires were simply over designed. Prices went up and tire companies made large amounts of money. 

When you buy a new car write down the tire size and speed rating before the purchase. Call and get quotes on what those tires will cost you to replace. 

Recently Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear joined together to create TireHub. This is a reorganizing of the distribution channel for tires. The only purpose of TireHub is to drive out competition and control the supply chain. Tires will become more expensive as Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear are the two largest tire manufacturers in the Americas. They are eliminating wholesalers. They will have complete control over the supply chain. 

The first casualties will be wholesalers like ATD American Tire Distributors. Then you will see the mom and pop tire shops disappear. Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear already control massive amounts of the replacement tire industry through their National Account Programs. 

A National Account Program is a buying program for any size company that has more than two company vehicles. The larger the company the larger the discounts. General Motors, Ford, Chrysler etc buy tires under the cost of manufacturing. Why? Because most people replace their tires with the original brand. If Michelin gives tires to Ford as OE fitments then it is guaranteed to get a large portion of the replacement market on that vehicle line. 

Companies like Spectrum, Enterprise Rent A Car, AT&amp;T buy tires at deep discounts. Such huge discounts that no one but the tire manufacturers can afford to sell them tires. This system has already eliminated most distribution channels other than direct distribution. 

What I write above is not a conspiracy. It can be independently verified with simple search engine searches.

What is a conspiracy theory is National City Lines. If you are not familiar with it you should be. The short version is that some of these players created a company that bought street cars, subways, railroads, and public transportation and then intentionally shut them down. They literally tore up rail road and street car track. Why? Because public transportation was a hinderance to the transportation business.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese man who embezzled $485 million from his employer in the biggest bank corruption case in China's history was repatriated on Wednesday by U.S.

These were big events took place a week ago. They looked like a concession made by Trump to China in trade negotiation. It is not. The tariffs problem is not resolved. The deport of Chinese most wanted indicates it's a secret deal between the Feds and Chinese secret police. I think they are framing a new drug case.

70,A report in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that this year’s flu vaccine was likely only 10% effective against influenza A,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s own report from February 2018 estimated flu vaccines’ effectiveness at 36%.

A report in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that this  year’s flu vaccine was likely only 10% effective against influenza A 

[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1714916](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1714916)

Evidence shows the flu vaccine actually contributes to causing the flu, rather than preventing it. The toxins and poisons contained in vaccinations lower one’s immunity to fight all illnesses, including influenza. These toxins include mercury,  formaldehyde, detergent and the flu virus. Researchers at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center found that women who received the flu vaccine had a weakened immune system response in subsequent years. The CDC has reported that older adults have a lower protective immune response after flu vaccinations, making them more susceptible to the flu.

74,English muffins,"English muffins, some of us wake up and devour one before setting off into our menial lives of labor and finance, some buy them for our kids so they'll shut up about how “they're hungry.” “you haven't fed us in weeks.” well, you might not know about the second lives of these elusive breakfast consumables, these flat circular spongy bread rolls made from yeast dough and eaten split, toasted, and buttered. (From Google.) As delicious as these unsuspecting docile invertebrate may seem, a wild one is quite the opponent, tearing full sized men limb to limb, snapping bones and tearing ligaments, these inhuman creatures have, as depicted in ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs, these berated outcasts have successfully worked their way into the very government we hold near and dear to our hearts, that's right folks, Trump is an English Muffin, that spongy, muffin-like skin, that-that horrible buttery hair, swishing back and forth in the fortuitous winds, carrying voices of love and hate, trust and disgust, have you ever felt the feeling of being watched, I’m sure you have, I have that feeling as i’m writing this, looking over my shoulder for signs of those treacherous muffins known as the yin, what didn’t expect that, think again! The yin are a china-based company dealing in the muffin trade (i.e. 1 muffin for 5$.) and muffin trafficking, sometimes trading their own members for sheer money. (i.e. 1 member for 5$) where do these horrifying acts happen you might ask? Well, look around, they happen at your local starbucks, airports, shady back alleys behind walmarts, at those walmarts, which really makes doing them behind the walmart meaningless if you ask me, seriously though, I feel like you would have to be so inconceivably stupid to deal behind a Wal-Mart and risk getting mugged just for that sweet trade of muffins for money. (I.e. 1 muffin for 5$) Now, have you heard of the cousin of the muffin? That's right, the frivolous  cupcake, meandering in its own flavorful delight, a cupcake is the perfect treat for a small child's birthday party if you want to make them fat and stupid. But what if I told you muffins weren't uglier versions of a cupcake, but cupcakes are more beautiful versions of a muffin. Cupcake dye is them getting a tan and the frosting is makeup. Now, the etiquette of a domesticated English muffin is quite gentle, yet intimidating, like a... I don't care enough to find an analogy. It doesn't move, respond, look at you, listen, or react. It just sits until you eat it. A wild one however, is hostile, devilish, any word you can think of to describe evil. Sheer, unbroken evil. It cannot be tamed and normally will destroy a town unless paid 5$ A tamed one wears a monocle while the untamed wears those plastic devil horns you can get at Walmart for 5$, generally breaking the band on the first day from stretching it too much. While the tamed jams a monocle into its own flesh in an attempt to look fashionable and “lit” as the cool kids say heh heh. *smokes blunt.* ah, that's the stuff, anyhow, those ruffians known as the yin are the ultimate cause of gang violence from muffins, they don't deserve such titles as scourge or plague, I will call them ruffians as a sort of misdemeaning insult to spite them. This got real suddenly, I didn't mean for it to get so real so fast. Let's change the subject to English muffin abuse, have you noticed when an English muffin is sold it is generally in a plastic wrap that suffocates the muffin, choking it in seconds. This is murder in the muffin world. A crime punishable by death. As they say, an eye for an eye, but alas, that also makes the world blind. Report this abusive behavior by dialing. (Insert National Health Organization number here.) Now, this could be a bit of a stretch, but if you search songs with the lyrics English muffin you'll find 18 lyrics, 10 artists and 100 albums, now put those together and you get 1810100, put that into google and you'll get some robertshaw product for tubing, now there's a school near here called Shaw Elementary, like Robert Shaw, it's an elementary school, and Sherlock Holmes says “Elementary my dear Watson.” Now, as aforementioned, English muffins wear monocles just like people in Sherlock’s time, it all comes full circle, you know what else is circular, an eye, now an oat bran muffin has 305 calories, and ¼ of a cup of sugar, meaning if you add the 1 and 4 together you get 5, subtract that from 305 and you get 300, because zero is nothing we can take those off and get 3, which is how many sides a triangle has. Boom. Mind blown. Illuminati. Originality. Woah. I'm so genius it hurts my head to think, I should write a book… onward then. Now, the illuminati was founded from a myth starting in the 1960’s, 1960 backwards is 0691, which is the China Shanshui Cement Group Limited, let's take the first and last word, China limited, which is an airline company (in china.) The Wright brothers invented airplanes in 1903, Wright sounds like right, now what is the opposite of right? Wrong, back to the Chinese thing, Chinese say wrong as wong, which is a character in doctor strange, and you know what else is strange? Illuminati. It's all come full circle for ivan. So, as stated by Google, over 135 years ago Samuel Bath Thomas, an innovator and entrepreneur, created the Original “Nooks &amp; Crannies” English Muffin after moving from England to the United States. He used a secret process that included griddle baking to create a muffin that was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Soft like melted chocolate, like on chocolate chip cookies, which my mom just made, mom backwards is mom, which sounds like ma’am, which sounds like nam, which is short for namco, which made Pac man, which was a big hit, you know what else was a hit? Yoshi Island, Japan is also an island, and Nintendo headquarters is in Kyoto, Japan, which sounds like koto, the musical instrument, which is like a harp, harp sounds like carp, carp can be rearranged to parc, which is a Xerox company, which means The illuminati is building robotic muffins to kill us all. The muffin has a prestigious and honorable backstory, going as follows: The year was early 1880, Samuel Bath Thomas, who was supposedly an entrepreneur and genius, he then went on to invent the English muffin out of all things with that genius… he called his recipe the “nooks and crannies.” He used a “secret” process called griddle baking. Then opened his own bakery in late 1880. So, I have to ask, it really secret if you open a diner and reveal it t your employees? Anyway, I just realized how much I use the word anyway since I don't know how to transition. But now, a beautiful Haiku, about Muffins.

English Muffins are

So incredibly smart.

I gritted my teeth. 

Now that last line might have seemed random, because it was. But, gritting your teeth wears them down, wearing clothes is what you do with them, clothes is what you put on your body, your body has organs, an organ is in a church, a church has a cross, your mom gets cross with you, so your mom. Alright, there’s a book series called muffin club, about some little girl who, I guess, is in a cult, sorry, club, having to do with muffins. This little girl, if you look closely, has two eyes, she does this to signify she has double the power of the illuminati, and could destroy them at any time. Open your eyes america, you’re not sheep. As aforementioned sheep, sheep are essential to our way of life, giving us only itchy wool sweaters that provide nothing and look terrible, seriously, who thinks they look good, anyhow, sheep have eyes too, “ Open your eyes america, you’re not sheep” is a common thing for conspiracy theorists to say, so obviously, (I mean seriously, come on.) all americans are sheep and this is their way of trying to trick other countries into thinking they’re not, think about it, there’s a saying, “pulling the wool over someone’s eyes.” this is a way of saying we’re blocking each other from the truth by, if we’re sheep, blocking each other from . It was created by the illuminati in 1912, which backwards is 2191, which means nothing to me. Just kidding, 2191 is a U.S. code for implementing trade agreements which obviously means the illuminati is trading with the U.S. idiot. Duh. wait… U.S. backwards is .s.u, remove that second dot and you’ve got yourself a top-level domain code for the soviet union issued on september 19th 1990. It was issued on september 19th and 19 backwards is 91, which matches psalms 91, which is in the bible. His quote is as follows: He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. Could this mean the U.S. is “He.” and the illuminati is the “Almighty.” This would be signifying that, although we never see them, they rule us from the “shadows.” I just realized this isn’t even about muffins anymore… WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!?!?!?!?! Now, we've gone over seemingly everything haven't we? Muggers, thieves, killers, murderers, what else is there in the world of crime? Well my dear acquaintance, we shall delve deeper, into the bowels of the criminal underground, that’s right, vegans. Vegans have always been strange, not adapting to the human diet of meat, changing the food chain and ruining our planet for all our kids you pricks, so they'll eat “tofu” a terrible tasting food only vegans should be subjected to you freaks of “nature.” these vegan muffins are so destructive they only want to destroy our planet like the rest of us, scoundrels. So, walruses They cause 0 deaths a year and are maybe the most peaceful creatures on earth, but, those tusks are scary, now imagine if those long, powerful ivory tusks ended in… an English muffin. So you could be stabbed with a muffin instead of that nasty tusk, well my friends, that is a possibility, we have scientists working on genetically altered walrus right at this very moment! The muffin gets soggy though, it's a real problem. Now we've had our fun, but you haven't seen anything until you've seen genetically altered muffins, these are the leanest meanest fighting muffins you've ever seen with your own 2 illuminati killing eyes. These things rip phone books with their own bare hands and stare down kittens, they terrorize towns and hit 5 stars faster than you can say pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (you can't.) Muffins have an interesting past, some leaving behind religion in an attempt at a more “worldly.” life in their words, one such risk taker is Pedro the English muffin, who left behind his family and all possessions for a life of such harshness and vulgar boldness, it's incredible really what people will give up for a life of freedom from society and domestication. 
Then he went on to become the savior of all humanity, he is known to us as Jesus. Then there was the great slaughter of 1822 where 6 million English muffins were slaughtered, this horrific event was caused by the leader of  ermandy, zitlers, temper tantrum and was known exclusively as the hologram. so, ah, I don't know what I'm doing with my life, no seriously, I could have spent my weekend STUDYING but NOOOOOOOO I had to be the big man and write a 3 page paper on ENGLISH GODDAMN MUFFINS.

I believe that there are openings or “holes” at the north and South Poles and that the government is actively hiding it and covering it up and here is why:

Admiral Byrd and his expeditions to the poles and his accounts of it. He kept a journal about being taken into the entrance at the North Pole and meeting the beings inside. They stated how they didn’t approve  of nuclear weapons and warned him that we should stop use of them

Operation High Jump- failed military deployment to Antarctica because of encounter with opposition of aerial threat with highly advanced aircraft.

The Nazi bases in Antarctica and the German documents of the maps and instructions on how to reach agartha.

The many different testimonies of various credible high ranking military personnel stating that ufo have directly interfered with nuclear tests and launches. (nuclear fallout on the surface may directly impact the well-being of them on the inside?) (see these videos:

[video](https://youtu.be/FbBc_LmXkbQ)

[video ](https://youtu.be/AYPpwPkoAls)

[video](https://youtu.be/x4wL4lbwwNU) )

Motive for non disclosure and non-contact- perhaps we haven’t made contact or had disclosure because they don’t want people on the surface to find out about the interior and come pouring in by the masses. 

-No fly zones and restricted areas at the north and south poles

-Antarctica and North Pole on google earth looks completely digitally airbrushed 

Anyways that’s just some food for thought. I Could be completely crazy, but still all seems very strange none the less.  Never know... the inside of the earth would have been a great place for the Atlantans to take shelter from the the cataclysms (great floods and such) 🧐😉

118,Redditors are a clever bunch — they will smell your marketing campaign a mile away. Inauthentic engagers will get the boot (translation: banned). But those who learn how to become part of a community and add value can reap the benefits,"&gt; ...(and more): Driving traffic. Branding, Testing new products, Selling products, Reaching your audience’s interests.

https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-every-marketer-should-be-on-reddit/262239/

Reddit is prime real estate for marketers and various PR firms.

The marketing of various conspiracy theories and the PR teams employed to oppose them are often a subject of debate.



&gt;Here are 13 standout stats provided to me by Reddit:

* No. 3 site in the U.S., No. 7 globally
*  330 million-plus monthly active users (MAU)
*  44 percent of the total MAU are on mobile apps / the mobile web
*   79 percent of users are between the ages of 18 and 34; that number is  * 58 percent when talking mobile web and mobile app users
* 46.7 million searches per day
* 51 percent of users are in the U.S.
*  70 percent of users are English-speaking
*   14 billion screen views per month on average
*   10 million-plus post submissions per month with more than 370,000 daily
*   2.8 million comments daily
*  58 million votes daily
* 138,000-plus active communities
*  80,000-plus moderators

...

&gt;Reddit is unlike other social networks in a very special way. The Reddit audience is one that is primed for and interested in learning and having in-depth conversations with one another on any topic you can think of.

&gt;The beauty of Reddit is that users self-select the topics they want to be involved in within various communities (called subreddits). This is in contrast to social networks like Facebook where branded content can seem intrusive to users wanting to catch up on friends, family, and fuzzy animals.

...

&gt;A lot of nuances exist around posting, so it’s best to get a sense of the culture, and know the global guidelines and subreddit-specific rules (each community has its own) before diving in.

...
&gt;Three keys to succeeding on Reddit:

* Become a community member.
* Don’t game or spam the system.
* Tread lightly with blatant marketing (users have historically been adverse to this, although it’s becoming more accepted over time).",conspiracy,1532398630,The_In-Betweener,6,6,True,2018-07-23

133,The Untold Story of Measles,"## Several decades following the vaccine’s introduction, the measles death rate rose, largely because the vaccine made adults, expectant mothers and infants more vulnerable.

Early in the last century, measles  killed millions of people a year. Then, bit by bit in countries of the  developed world, the death rate dropped, **by the 1960s by 98% or more. In the U.K., it dropped by an astounding 99.96%. And then, the measles vaccine entered the market.**  


After  the vaccine’s introduction, the measles death rate continued to drop into the 1970s. Many scientists credit the continued decline entirely to the vaccine. Other scientists believe the vaccine played a minor role, if that, noting that most infectious diseases similarly petered out  during the 20th century, including some, like scarlet fever, for which vaccines were never developed.

# The  credit for the century-long decline, scientists generally agree, goes to improved nutrition and improved health care, side effects of the West’s growing affluence. 

**In the U.S., the death rate dropped by about 98%, from about 10 per 100,000 population a century ago to one fifth of one person by 1963, the year measles vaccines made their American debut.**  Both before and after vaccination started, victims tended to be poor.  


A study in the *American Journal of Public Health*,  “Measles mortality in the United States 1971-1975,” found the measles  death rate to be almost 10 times higher among families whose median income was less than $5,000 than among families whose income exceeded a modest $10,000. Families outside metropolitan areas, who tended to have  poor healthcare, had three times the death rate.

An earlier, landmark study in the *American Journal of Epidemiolog*y by the Center for Disease Control’s Roger Barkin found similar disturbing results of measles’ toll on the disadvantaged. Here race entered the picture because black children were disproportionately victimized, not by the measles virus per se but by poverty. A poor black child and a poor white child had the same high chance of dying from measles, but because white children rarely lived in abject poverty,  measles claimed the blacks.  


Measles  didn’t only discriminate by income — in another study, Barkin found  that children with underlying diseases were particularly vulnerable, and that the “majority of this group were physically or mentally retarded,  or both.” The realization that measles was selective in whom it killed led Barkin to emphasize that vulnerable populations, rather than the general population, should be targeted for measles vaccination.  


In the pre-vaccine era, when the natural measles virus infected the entire  population, **measles — “typically a benign childhood illness,”** as *Clinical Pediatrics*  described it — was welcomed for providing lifetime immunity, thus  avoiding dangerous adult infections. In today’s vaccine era, adults have  accounted for one quarter to one half of measles cases; most of them involve pneumonia, one-quarter of them hospitalization.  


Also  importantly, measles during pregnancies have risen dangerously because  expectant mothers no longer have lifetime immunity. **Today’s vaccinated  expectant mothers are at risk because the measles vaccine wanes with time and because it often fails to protect against measles.**  
   
A study in Houston of 12 pregnant women and one who had just given birth,  all of whom had measles, found one died, seven suffered pneumonia and seven hepatitis, four went through premature labour and one lost her child in a spontaneous abortion. A study of eight measles pregnancies in Japan found three ended in spontaneous abortions or stillbirths while four babies were born with congenital measles; two mothers endured pneumonia and one hemorrhagic shock. A Los Angeles study of 58 such pregnancies found 21 ended prematurely (three induced abortions, five  spontaneous abortions and 13 preterm deliveries); 35 of the 58 mothers were hospitalized, 15 contracted pneumonia, and two died.  
   
The  danger extends to babies, whose bodies are too immature to receive  measles vaccination before age one, making them entirely dependent on  antibodies inherited from their mothers. In their first year out of the  womb, infants suffer the highest rate of measles infections and the most lasting harm. Yet vaccinated mothers have little antibody to pass on —  only about one-quarter as much as mothers protected by natural measles —  leaving infants vulnerable three months after birth, according to a  study last year in the *Journal of Infectious Diseases*.  HIV-infected children, who may account for most recent measles-related  child deaths, also suffer when their mothers have been vaccinated, since  HIV further reduces the antibodies they inherit.  


**Factors  such as these increased the death rate for adults and the very young,  helping to reverse the decline in deaths seen in previous decades**,  according to a 2004 study in the *Journal of Infectious Disease*, authored by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  


Vaccines  for measles have had spotty safety records. Soon after their  introduction, the Vital Statistics of the United States began recording  deaths from the measles vaccine, along with deaths from other vaccines.  By 1970, one of the two original **measles vaccines was withdrawn in Canada and the U.S**. after causing atypical measles syndrome, a harsh disease triggering high rates of pneumonia. In 1975, **the second original vaccine was withdrawn** due to 103-degrees-plus fevers, among other severe side effects. **Two variants of this vaccine also proved  unsatisfactory**. **A measles vaccine then became part of the combination MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine in the 1980s, only to be withdrawn  in 1990 by Canada and in 1992** by the manufacturer after reports from Canada, the U.S., Sweden and Japan **blamed MMR for febrile convulsions,  meningitis, deafness and deaths**. A second version of MMR, now in  widespread use, is believed safe by government officials.

Safety  aside, vaccines repeatedly failed worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s. As  described in “Measles Elimination in Canada”, a 2004 report authored by  Canadian government officials and academics, “despite virtually 100%  documented one-dose coverage in some regions, large outbreaks of measles  involving thousands of cases persisted … Clearly, because of **primary  vaccine failure**, Canada’s one-dose program was insufficient.”

The  solution finally arrived at — adding a second dose for children —  initially seemed to tame measles outbreaks. But in recent years, the new  vaccination regime, too, has been failing, with widespread outbreaks again occurring, including among those who have received the recommended dose and especially among infants too young to be vaccinated, and thus unprotected because their mothers had been vaccinated. Now health experts, scrambling to find solutions, are suggesting numerous reforms, including earlier child vaccinations and second doses for adults.

# Clearly,  the science is not settled

Making for parents a numbers game of the  decision to vaccinate their children. Some parents rely on the press or  health authorities to interpret the numbers. Others defy the authorities  and weigh the risks in the numbers differently, in deciding what’s best  for their own families. Who are these others? According to a survey in Pediatrics,  **unvaccinated children in the U.S. have a mother who is at least 30  years old, who has at least one college degree and whose household has  an annual income of at least $75,000.** In the absence of studies showing vaccinated children to be healthier than those unvaccinated, the parents  in these educated households have determined that the numbers argue  against vaccination.

It was during this time that I was recruited as a deep undercover operative for the FBI. In the following months I developed a strategy for inspiring peaceful political revolution in the United States against the current White House administration as well as inspiring revolution in foreign countries involving the destruction of foreign satellites, the control of international civilian and government broadcasts, and a certain cyber-security tactic which I am reluctant to explain due to the interest of national security. Initially I was gaslighted, had my smartphone and computer bugged etc. Eventually I was captured, drugged, and psychologically tortured by people loyal to the White House when it became evident I was unwilling to work with them or accept a payoff. My best guess is that they were most likely Russian actors or members of the mob. I escaped, have been suffering from PTSD, as well as the fact that no one; not my friends or family, the Washington Post, or the New York Times will respond or believe my story as it is mostly anecdotal.

Stanley Bolten,

News reporter Brian D. Hill, formerly of defunct USWGO Alternative News, has filed a response letter and evidence disc to U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia regarding the corruption of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Copies mailed to [U.S. Senator Kaine](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tRef=fullpage&amp;tLc=3&amp;text28777=&amp;tLabels=70160600000083199220) (D-VA) and [U.S. Congressman Morgan Griffith](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tRef=fullpage&amp;tLc=3&amp;text28777=&amp;tLabels=70171450000094112945) (R-VA) have both been confirmed as delivered by the United States Postal Service according to the tracking numbers of [two certified mail receipts](https://justiceforuswgo.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/certified-mail-receipts-of-mailings-to-senator-tim-kaine-and-rep-morgan-griffith.pdf).

Brian's mother, Roberta Hill, has emailed me a WinRAR encrypted archive (w/password) of everything that was inside of the mixed Audio/DATA CD disc that was mailed to the U.S. Congress. So far it appears that the copies of the evidence and letter (directed at U.S. Senator Tim Kaine) have not yet been mailed to U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), and U.S. Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC).

It appears that Brian has finally decided to send copies of (1) various faxes of evidence that he had faxed to different FBI office fax numbers in the past, (2) copies of the Audio file recordings of the voicemails he had left with the Greensboro FBI office, (3) copies of the Audio file recordings of the voicemails the Greensboro FBI office had left with Brian, (4) copy of the originally faxed Joint Congressional request letter in regards to the Greensboro FBI corruption, (5) Stuff that he had already faxed to the FBI concerning documents he was preparing prior to faxing, (6) his response to U.S. Senator Tim Kaine regarding the Greensboro FBI corruption, (7) copies of mailing record and documentation that was originally mailed to the FBI duty agent Jerry Pickford in the FBI office in Greensboro, (8) and a copy of his original FOIA request to the FBI and their response with the FOIA request tracking number.

 It appears that Brian has sent a lot of information about the corrupt Greensboro, NC FBI office, and mentioning about the corruption of the U.S. Attorney Office for the Middle District of North Carolina. All of that has appeared to have been mailed to the U.S. Congress. So the offices of both U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and U.S. Congressman Morgan Griffith of Virginia have received the evidence of the audio tracks of the Audio side of the disc and then the documents inside of the DATA side of the disc. The 9 page letter, the envelope scans, scans of the CD-ROM discs, and certified mail receipts that were proposed for the letter have all been mailed.

I don't read a lot of incel writing, but the it read almost as a comical take on what incels would say. ""Sergeant 4chan"" and ""supreme gentleman"" really?

Then in May there was the bombing of an Indian restaurant, where the suspects are still at large. On the Canadian subs it has been concluded that it was a targeted gang hit. This doesn't make sense because if you are trying to kill one person why attract more attention to your self with a bomb, that is not even guaranteed to kill your target? If it was a car bomb that would make sense, but they just chucked it in the restaurant and left. Also gangs don't typically bomb restaurants they shoot people, which Toronto has also been experiencing a rise in shootings  I have been following the story closely and there has been no updates at all,and it seems it has also been swept under the rug. 

Now in July there was the heightened security where Toronto police were expecting a car ramming, that never happened, and now the shooting. I am wondering if the shooter was who they were tipped off about for the car ramming, or if these incidents are somehow connected. ",conspiracy,1532409776,teddyrooseveltsfist,17,14,True,2018-07-24

It could be useful to consider how things would change if the dictionary did not support this counterargument. What if whites could not meaningfully use the word ""racism"" when they were targeted for their race? (I say ""whites"" only for the convenience of an institutionalized example.) There are some synonyms, but they lack the force of this word.

151,How the word “gender” was hijacked by post modern ideologies.,"In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead. But the post modern interpretation of the difference between sex and gender is irrational and unscientific because of biology and worldwide historical precedent. 

For example, no other language in the world (except closely related to English) distinguishes the difference between sex and gender. Try to translate the word sex or gender into another language and there is only one word for it. Some languages like Spanish even genders their nouns to masculine and feminine. 
The label “transgender” can be translated and this group of people have existed throughout history, among all groups of people. 
Today the word gender has been weaponized to somehow imply there are more than 2 sexes/genders. Meaningless words like genderqueer, genderless or gender neutral were introduced. The fact is, an individual cannot force society to separate sex from social/gender roles that are attached to it, since these familial roles are essential for reproduction and an integral part of the social fabric. These gender/sex roles were used throughout all human history regardless of location. This fundamental subversion of social norms is used to further divide the people so they are distracted from the real issues and fragmented groups are easier to manipulate. Pseudo-intellectuals are paid to endorse transient and sterile relationships and this will weaken the social order. 
Ultimately the post modernists are working for the interests of the oligarchs than the interests of the general public. ",conspiracy,1532416961,GlobalPowerElite,74,12,True,2018-07-24

Interesting that they come from the Scottish Rite and that a lot of this ""degree"" relates to Trump way too much if you think of him becoming President, that he was chosen for this, becoming the Antichrist as a necessary part of God's word and that it is a part of the cosmic order of the universe, or at least Earth. Yin and Yang. He's necessary to pull people in their respective directions, separating the wheat from the chaff. As Jesus said was necessary before the harvest. Maybe the Evangelicals were right, he was chosen, just not exactly how they thought and for the purpose they thought. This seems to be the only Degree that tells you to contact them for more information. Seems like this is for someone of high importance who is selected for the position  


So something about these secret societies, they lie about their symbols and what they mean at times. They obviously do this for a reason. They say diamond shaped symbol on the emblem is a ""Silver Trowel"" which is a digging or gardening tool. This could be partially true. Here is what they look like.

&gt; **What is the Spear of Destiny, and where can you get it?**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A spear with a mystical background gives the one wielding it powers to bend the destiny of the world to his or her will. It sounds like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but truth is far more bizarre in this case, as the legend of the Spear of Destiny contains a poison pill clause — once the spear leaves the possession of a ruler, the individual dies within a matter of days.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kings and dictators sought out a legendary spear that pierced the heart of Jesus of Nazareth, deemed the Spear of Destiny, with several different artifacts laying claim to the name over the centuries. Are any of the relics real? Is there any hope that the authentic Spear of Destiny is floating around somewhere?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The top image is of the Vienna Lance, held at the Weltliches Schatzkammer Museum in Vienna, Austria.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**World shaping powers**  
The Spear of Destiny (also known as the Holy Lance) is a name given to the spear used by a Roman soldier to pierce the side of Jesus of Nazareth several hours into crucifixion.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark centers on Hitler's predilection toward religious artifacts — but his obsession with this particular item isn't fictional. Historical records show that Hitler obtained the Spear of Destiny after annexing Austria in 1938, and brought the spear to St. Katherine's Church in Nuremberg for safe keeping. Stories circle around Hitler's fascination with the Spear of Destiny, which he first viewed as a young, nineteen-year-old painter in the Weltliches Schatzkammer Museum.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Lore connects the spear to several rulers through the centuries, including Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, and Alaric, the King of the Visigoths who ransacked of Rome. Charlemagne carried the spear through 47 battles, with legend claiming he died immediately after dropping the relic. Napoleon also sought the spear, but never obtained the relic. The holders of the spear believed it gave them power to control the destiny of the world, but with one fatal caveat – the holder dies soon after the spear leaves their possession. 

 Interesting.  


&gt;  
During the 7th Century AD, the point of this second spear breaks off for an unknown reason. The separated tip is sent to Constantinople and enters the possession of Louis the IX of France in the 13th Century. The point is lost in the late 1700s during the upheaval of the French Revolution.

In my 2nd to last post, I claimed that Trump was the ""tip of the spear"" before I ever even heard of this.

And in my very last post, I posted an interview where Hitler is spoken about and the conversation mirrors a lot of the conversation around Trump today.

[https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90vhph/is\_what\_were\_seeing\_with\_trump\_and\_putin/](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90vhph/is_what_were_seeing_with_trump_and_putin/)

Could Trump have the tip of the Spear of Destiny? Hitler believed in the Hollow Earth and it is said he never died but went through a portal. In the Baron Trump books I talk about [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8tuwr1/what_do_these_2_very_obvious_signs_say_to_you/), Baron Trump is told about ""A world within a world"" and there are portals to this world that he must find. Coincidence? Considering the links with his uncle and Tesla, this starts to get A LOT weirder.

# Pepe the Frog, Revelations and Ancient Egypt

I've been reading into the idea that the Levites were the ones who started the Illuminati and considering they came out of Egypt with Moses and were made into the Priests, it makes a lot of sense. Jewish Kabbalism. The Cabal everyone talks about. They got that knowledge from the Ancient Egyptians. Not to mention that they wear the same clothing as the Whore of Babylon is described as wearing and Jesus speaks about certain people not being real Jews in the Revelations. Jewish Mysticism is some interesting stuff. This could go all the way back to the Mark of Cain and the Curse of Ham. Phoenicia is somehow connected to this too in the brief time I looked into it. Phoenicia = Phoenix. Very strongly associated with the color Purple.

So everyone remembers Pepe the frog and the Praise Kek stuff that was going around like crazy on the Trump forums during the campaign?   


&gt;  
**Revelation 16**  
13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

&gt;**Okay, What The Hell Is Going On?**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Most likely? Chaos Magick.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;You see, one of the core tenets of Chaos Magick practice (the only mainstay, really) is the creation of magic sigils (also called “glyphs”) to “codify and project one’s Will into the Universe.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Basically, you make an image that represents your “will” (desire fueled by powerful emotions or altered states) and the universe will take care of the rest.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;When a lot of people pool their united willpower towards a single sigil, its called a Hypersigil, and its exponentially more potent.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pepe/Kek is 4chan’s hypersigil.**   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Millions of the “little people” that browse 4chan have embedded the image of Pepe with their hatred for Hillary’s alleged corruption, and their hope for Trump’s victory over her in November. Whether they did this consciously or not, its exactly what has happened.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;And so far, their hypersigil seems to be working.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hold Up: You’re Seriously Telling Me Magic Is Real?**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Absolutely I am. But you must understand, “magic” probably isn’t what you think it is. It’s not about wand-waving or pentagrams or sacrificing babies.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Magick is actually much less involved than that. As a matter of fact, you’re casting magick right now. You pretty much always are, whether you like it or not.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s because the REAL magic comes from plain and simple human attention. How you look at reality shapes it in ways that we’re only now beginning to fully understand. Ironically, the science of quantum physics is rapidly bringing the reality of magick to light (shadilay).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In my book You’re Imagining Things, I’ll tell you how it works–and WHY it works–in plain-spoken English. I’ll also explain how you can use your attention to alter your own little pocket of reality in extraordinary ways.

This is Roy Cohn, holding up a picture with him and Trump together. He was one of Trump's biggest influences and mentors. He apparently had a thing for frogs. Coincidence? If you don't know who he is, look him up. Might as well be the devil incarnate. Roy Cohn, Roger Stone and Donald Trump are some kind of holy trinity of evil. You should watch Get Me Roger Stone on Netflix. It's eye opening. 

Trump was voted into office with the help of Ancient Egyptian cult magic that was foretold about in the book of Revelation. I'm not kidding either. This Kabbalah shit is real. It's like ""The Secret"" and even Jesus talked about this stuff which I pointed out in this thread too. Belief and intention create reality. In that 1958 TV show with Trump in it I speak about in one of my posts, his ""wall"" has symbols on it that he says will protect them from the meteorites. They're Occult symbols. The Baron Trump books? Full of Occultism. Lots of UFOs were even spotted around the world during that time period too along with the resurgence of the Hollow Earth Theory. 

How fucking ironic is it that these people were screaming about the Cabal using Satanic energy to manipulate mankind and then they use it unknowingly to bring about the destruction of us all? I don't even know if there are words that can convey that much irony.  


Listen to the July 4th episode of The Ben Shapiro Show and skip to the part where Jordan Peterson comes in. He talks about the Ancient Egyptians and how they believed they created reality with their words. He also talks about how Gods slay the beast of chaos and make chaos out of order. That's the Antichrist, the beast of Chaos. The hero is whoever takes him out and order comes out of that process to create a new world. Which is why their symbol is the Phoenix. What's interesting is that Trump isn't a Leo but he has it ascending on his chart or something like that, plus Regulus being a part of his chart and that being the heart of the lion. But you know who is a Leo though? Obama. Apparently they just named some 500 million year old disc shaped creature that lived on the bottom of the ocean after him, calling it Obamus ""Coronatus"" (meaning crowned). Interestingly enough, the legend of the Phoenix says that it lives for 500 years before rebirth.

You notice the crying guy picture in the article where he's begging them to stop because they could meme us out of existence? The post number ended with 33. 33 is the number of Christ consciousness. Maybe they should have listened to him.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_cosmism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism) 

&gt;Russian cosmism is a philosophical and cultural movement that emerged in Russia in the early 20th century. It entailed a broad theory of natural philosophy, combining elements of religion and ethics with a history and philosophy of the origin, evolution and future existence of the cosmos and humankind. It combined elements from both Eastern and Western philosophic traditions as well as from the Russian Orthodox Church.    
&gt;  
&gt;Cosmism was one of the influences on Proletkult, and after the October Revolution, the term came to be applied to ""the poetry of such writers as Mikhail Gerasimov and Vladimir Kirillov...: emotional paeans to physical labor, machines, and the collective of industrial workers ... organized around the image of the universal 'Proletarian,' who strides forth from the earth to conquer planets and stars.""\[1\] This form of cosmism, along with the writings of Nikolai Fyodorov, was a strong influence on Andrei Platonov.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Many ideas of the Russian cosmists were later developed by those in the transhumanist movement**. Victor Skumin argues that the Culture of Health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society into the Solar System.    
&gt;  
&gt;The Culture of Health is the basic science about Spiritual Humanity. It studies the perspectives of harmonious development of ""Spiritual man"" and ""Spiritual ethnos"" as a conscious creator of the State of Light into the territory of the Solar System"" (by Skumin).

&gt;**The Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin** *Where Trump's real estate world meets a top religious ally of the Kremlin.*   
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad of Port Washington, a Jewish community center on Long Island’s Manhasset Bay, sits in a squat brick edifice across from a Shell gas station and a strip mall. The center is an unexceptional building on an unexceptional street, save for one thing: Some of the shortest routes between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin run straight through it.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Despite its small size, Chabad has grown to become the most sprawling Jewish institution in the world, with a presence in over 1,000 far-flung cities, including locales like Kathmandu and Hanoi with few full-time Jewish residents. The movement is known for these outposts, called Chabad houses, which function as community centers and are open to all Jews. “Take any forsaken city in the world, you have a McDonald’s and a Chabad house,” explained Ronn Torossian, a Jewish public relations executive in New York.    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad adherents differ from other Hasidic Jews on numerous small points of custom, including the tendency of Chabad men to wear fedoras instead of fur hats. Many adherents believe that the movement’s last living leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died in 1994, is the messiah, and some believe he is still alive. Chabad followers are also, according to Klein, “remarkable” fundraisers.    
&gt;  
&gt;As the closest thing the Jewish world has to evangelism—much of its work is dedicated to making Jews around the world more involved in Judaism—Chabad serves many more Jews who are not full-on adherents.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;To those unfamiliar with Russian politics, Trump’s world and Hasidic Judaism, all these Chabad links can appear confounding. Others simply greet them with a shrug.    
&gt;  
&gt;“The interconnectedness of the Jewish world through Chabad is not surprising insofar as it’s one of the main Jewish players,” said Boteach. “I would assume that the world of New York real estate isn’t that huge either.”

  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad#Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad#Philosophy) 

&gt;Chabad Hasidic philosophy focuses on religious and spiritual concepts such as God, the soul, and the meaning of the Jewish commandments. **Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the Zohar and the Kabbalah of Rabbi Isaac Luria, are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources of Chabad teachings and as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors**. Chabad philosophy is rooted in the teachings of Rabbis Yisroel ben Eliezer, (the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism) and Dovber ben Avraham, the ""Maggid of Mezritch"" (Rabbi Yisroel's successor).

&gt;""The messiah's coming is not simply the redemption of the Jews. But a general change in the entire world. We will recognize that God encompasses past, present and future as one.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem\_Mendel\_Schneerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson)

&gt;**Menachem Mendel Schneerson** (April 18, 1902 OS – June 12, 1994 / AM 11 Nissan 5662 – 3 Tammuz 5754), known to many as the Lubavitcher Rebbe or simply as the Rebbe, was a Russian Empire–born American Orthodox Jewish rabbi, and the last rebbe of the Lubavitcher Hasidic dynasty. He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century.    
&gt;  
&gt;He was born in the Black Sea port of Nikolaev in the Russian Empire (now Mykolaiv in Ukraine). **His father was rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, a renowned Talmudic scholar and authority on Kabbalah and Jewish law**. His mother was Rebbetzin Chana Schneerson (nee Yanovski). He was named after the third Chabad rebbe, the Tzemach Tzedek, from whom he was a direct patrilineal descendent.    
&gt;  
&gt;As leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in religious world Jewry, with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers. The institutions he established include kindergartens, schools, drug-rehabilitation centers, care-homes for the disabled and synagogues.    
&gt;  
&gt;Schneerson's published teachings fill more than 300 volumes, and he is noted for his contributions to Jewish continuity and religious thought, as well as his wide-ranging contributions to traditional Torah scholarship. He is recognized as the pioneer of Jewish outreach. Many of his adherents refused to believe that he died on June 12, 1994, believing instead that he did not really die but will reveal himself to be the messiah    
&gt;  
&gt;**Israel**   
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad is officially non-Zionist. Schneerson referred to the State of Israel as ""bitter exile and double-fold darkness,"" while other senior Chabad rabbis described the rebbe as one of the great fighters against Zionism.    
&gt;  
&gt;At the same time, Schneerson took great interest in the affairs of the state of Israel, and did whatever was in his power to support the infrastructure of the state and advance its success. He was concerned with the agricultural, industrial and overall economic welfare of Israel, and sought to promote its scientific achievements, and enhance Israel's standing in the international community. Schneerson consistently expressed enormous recognition of the role of the Israel Defense Forces and stated that those who serve in the Israeli army perform a great Mitzva.

&gt;**Ex-Chabad Member Exposes Trump Family Cult** *I'll describe Chabad the way I see it given my past membership in it. Chabad is a racist organization - a Jewish supremacist missionary cult whose main goal is Jewish total superiority over the ""Goyim"" and their enslavement.*   
&gt;  
&gt;Jonas E. Alexis: Rabbi Yitzhak Ginzburg is an interesting individual because he has interesting things to say about the Goyim. He argues that there is an eternal or cosmic gap between the Goyim and “The Chosen.” He declares:    
&gt;  
&gt;“If every single cell in a Jewish body entails divinity, and is thus part of God, then every strand of DNA is a part of God. Therefore, something is special about Jewish DNA…    
&gt;  
&gt;“If a Jew needs a liver, can he take the liver of an innocent non-Jew to save him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value. There is something more holy and unique about Jewish life than about non-Jewish life.”\[1\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Stephen Steinlight, former Director of National Affairs for the American Jewish Committee (one of the most powerful Jewish organizations in the United States), stated bluntly,    
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ll confess it, at least: like thousands of other typical Jewish kids of my generation, I was reared as a Jewish nationalist, even a quasi-separatist…I was taught the superiority of my people to the gentiles who had oppressed us.    
&gt;  
&gt;“We were taught to view non-Jews as untrustworthy outsiders, people from whom sudden gusts of hatred might be anticipated, people less sensitive, intelligent, and moral than ourselves. We were also taught that the lesson of our dark history is that we could rely on no one.”\[2\]    
&gt;  
&gt;**Michael Chabon of the New York Times concurs:**   
&gt;  
&gt;“As a Jewish child I was regularly instructed, both subtly and openly, that Jews, the people of Maimonides, Albert Einstein, Jonas Salk and Meyer Lansky, were on the whole smarter, cleverer, more brilliant, more astute than other people.    
&gt;  
&gt;“And, duly, I would look around the Passover table, say, at the members of my family, and remark on the presence of a number of highly intelligent, quick-witted, shrewd, well-educated people filled to bursting with information, explanations and opinions on a diverse range of topics.”\[3\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabon now pokes fun at what he referred to as “nonsense” and “our own stupidity as a people,”\[4\] but this just shows how ingrained the smarter-than-thou attitude is.    
&gt;  
&gt;In 2010, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef unapologetically declared,    
&gt;  
&gt;“Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world—only to serve the People of Israel. In Israel, death has no dominion over them…    
&gt;  
&gt;“With gentiles, it will be like any person—they need to die, but \[God\] will give them longevity…Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. That is why gentiles were created.”\[5\]    
&gt;  
&gt;The rabbi, according to Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky, also saw that “Jews killing non-Jews does not constitute murder according to the Jewish religion and that killing of innocent Arabs for reasons of revenge is a Jewish virtue.”\[6\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Scheerson, known as Lubovitcher Rebbe and the seventh of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, came close to believing in something similar, saying that “a non-Jew should be punished by death if he kills an embryo, even if the embryo is non-Jewish, while the Jew should not be, even if the embryo is Jewish.”\[7\] The great Rabbi expanded on this view in 1965:    
&gt;  
&gt;“The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person stems from the common expression: ‘Let us differentiate.’ Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather, we have a case of “let us differentiate” between totally different species.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;**WHAT AND WHO IS CHABAD?**   
&gt;  
&gt;I’ll describe Chabad the way I see it given my past membership in it. Chabad is a racist organization – a Jewish supremacist missionary cult whose main goal is Jewish total superiority over the “Goyim” and their enslavement.    
&gt;  
&gt;Its central commandment is fulfilling the commandment “Breaking Through” i.e. making the world safe for Zionist world domination.    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad train their young to be emissaries when they grow up. Being “emissary” in Chabad terms means spreading their racist ideology to Jews all over the world – especially those who are not practicing Judaism. They give ideological and moral support for the Zionist Globalist Agenda.    
&gt;  
&gt;They see the enslavement of the “Goyim” through the international Jewish banks and the international politics as serving their Messianic prophecies – a future world where the New World Order controls all the nations of the world.    
&gt;  
&gt;Under their leader Rabbi Menachem Mendel (1902-1994), the movement established a network of nearly 4,000 institutions that provide religious, social and ideological support to Jews in over 1,000 cities, spanning 100 countries including all US states.    
&gt;  
&gt;**JEWS ARE GOD. GENTILES ARE INSECTS WHOSE ONLY PURPOSE IS TO SERVE JEWS OR DIE**   
&gt;  
&gt;According to Chabad, Jews themselves are “God”. Usury is permitted and encouraged against non-Jews (This is the motive of the NWO bankers). Chabad’s movement book “The Tania” is all about the Jews being God on Earth and non-Jews as being no more than animals – inferior without souls. If they do have souls their souls are demonic and satanic and originate in the “Klipot A’thmeot” i.e. the unholy spheres or the “Sitrha Achra”.    
&gt;  
&gt;Gentiles are animals without souls in their eyes. The “Jewish Soul” is God incarnate. The entire universe—including the trillions of galaxies, stars and planets—were created solely for the Jews and by God YHVH who is actually a manifestation of the Jewish people itself. One finger nail of a Jew is worth more than the entire non-Jewish world populations (That includes Europeans, Muslims, Asians and Africans) according to Chabad…    
&gt;  
&gt;**THE New World Order AGENDA**   
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad is nothing more than a manifestation of the Jewish racism that fuels the NWO agenda. Israel’s founder and former Prime Minister David Ben Gurion’s envisioned the Jews as being at the center of the One World Government dream. This will be the fulfillment of the promises of the Bible where the Jews will be the controllers and rulers of all the nations of the world in the time to come.    
&gt;  
&gt;The Jerusalem Supreme Court was built to support this agenda as envisioned by Ben Gurion:    
&gt;  
&gt;“In Jerusalem, the United Nations (a truly United Nations) will build a shrine of the prophets to serve the federated union of all continents; this will be the seat of the Supreme Court of Mankind, to settle all controversies among the federated continents, as prophesied by Isaiah…”    
&gt;  
&gt;Guess who funded and built the “Supreme Court”? The controllers of the world banks i.e. the Rothschilds of course! The Jewish Racist and supremacist agenda is blatantly in your face… It is simply a matter of 2+2=4.    
&gt;  
&gt;Cabala and Satanism are a means to weaken their host nations so they can more easily control these nations by degrading them. This is how they maintain their money monopoly. Hence we become more materialistic and less spiritual (look at modern “art” for example) and are then more easily controlled and enslaved    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;**Henry Makow:** Michael Berg demonstrated that Trump’s family (Kushners) belongs to Chabad, a racist, criminal Jewish supremacist doomsday cult. Trump commuted the 27-year prison sentence of Chabad kosher butcher, Rabbi Sholom Rabashkin, 57, a GOP donor. He had served only eight years.    
&gt;  
&gt;“Rubashkin, as manager of the family owned Agriprocessors meat plant ($300 million annual revenue) in Postville, Iowa, was convicted in 2009 of financial fraud for submitting fake invoices to the plant’s bank that made the company’s finances appear healthier than they were so that it could borrow more. The bankruptcy revealed a $26 million scheme of fraud.    
&gt;  
&gt;“In addition, in one of the nation’s largest illegal worker busts, federal authorities raided the plant and detained 389 illegal immigrants in 2008. ICE determined that at the time of their raid, two-thirds of the plant’s workers were undocumented. It turned out the company itself was cranking out false social security cards.    
&gt;  
&gt;“There were also 9,311 counts of child labor violations in the indictments, as well as horrific safety violations.”    
&gt;  
&gt;“Plant supervisors in this hell-on-earth were involved in rape and sexual abuse of workers. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) also documented and filmed what they called the worst animal abuses and extreme cruelty they had ever seen.    
&gt;  
&gt;“The Rubashkin criminal exploits and methods were documented in the CNBC series ‘American Greed – The Slaughterhouse.’ The video has now been scrubbed from CNBC’s site. It has been mirrored elsewhere, but this may not be online long.”    
&gt;  
&gt;The White House statement cited letters of support for review of Rubashkin’s case from more than 30 members of Congress of both parties, including House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and veteran Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.    
&gt;  
&gt;Trump also pointed to bipartisan expressions of support for review of the case from over (100 former high-ranking U.S. Justice Department officials, prosecutors, judges and legal scholars.)    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;**Jonas E. Alexis:** The man who actually persuaded Trump to pardon Sholom Rubashkin was none other than Alan Dershowitz,\[19\] the very person who got caught plagiarizing and then got away with it.\[20\] Dershowitz—get this—brought up the issue of “anti-Semitism” in Rubashkin’s case!\[21\] Even the Jewish Daily Forward itself acknowledged:    
&gt;  
&gt;“AgriProcessors employees received little safety training, earned unusually low salaries and endured tough conditions. Many were undocumented immigrants.”\[22\]    
&gt;  
&gt;And then this: “Dershowitz argued to Trump that prosecutors had unfairly manipulated Rubashkin’s sentence by driving down the company’s sale price, which increased the losses suffered by the banks that Rubashkin was found guilty of defrauding and therefore boosting his sentence. The federal judge who oversaw the case had rejected that argument in a ruling in January, but Trump was intrigued.”\[23\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Dershowitz said: “When I explained that to the president, he understood that from a business point of view.”\[24\] The Jewish Daily Forward declared: “A few months later, on December 20, Trump commuted the remainder of Rubashkin’s sentence, freeing him from the Otisville, New York prison where he has spent the past eight years and sending Brooklyn’s Orthodox community into ecstasy.”\[25\]    
&gt;  
&gt;So, both Henry Makow and Michael Berg are right on target: Trump is a representative of the Chabad movement and people like Alan Dershowitz. Trump’s report card at the end of 2017, especially when it comes to foreign policy, is complete failure. There is no such thing as “America First” when it comes to Trump. What we have seen thus far is “Chabad First”; “Israel First”; “Saudi Arabia First”; “Netanyahu First”; and “Alan Dershowitz First.” The only people who think that Trump is getting an A are Alex Jones and the Christian Zionist movement.

&gt;Israel had remained largely neutral in the Syrian civil war but wanted Assad to go, and was quietly helping Syrians across their border with emergency medical care and humanitarian support. But when the United States made clear it will not intervene in southern Syria to stop Assad and Russia, Netanyahu cut a deal with Putin to make sure Israel’s interests were protected.    
&gt;  
&gt;Under the deal, Israel (and now the United States, presumably) will formally endorse the Assad regime’s control over the area and work to implement the 1974 agreement, which sets the physical borders and provides for U.N. observers to be deployed in between the Syrians and Israelis. Under the new deal, Russia agrees to keep Iranian troops and proxy groups 80 kilometers, or about 50 miles, from Israel’s border (if they can), and Putin promises not to object if Israel strikes Iranian assets in southern Syria, especially if Iran deploys weapons that threaten Israel, such as strategic missiles or anti-aircraft systems.    
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Trump has made clear that his priority is to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria and damn the consequences. His national security advisers believe that would be disastrous and are trying to show progress before the president loses all patience and scraps the mission altogether. Trump has already frozen all stabilization assistance to Syria’s northeast, an area struggling to recover from years under Islamic State rule. 

 This article explains Putin's connections with the Chabad 

  
[Putin’s Chosen People: What’s behind the Russian president’s close relationship with an Orthodox Jewish sect?](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/11/vladimir_putin_chabad_what_s_behind_the_russian_president_s_close_relationship.html)  
 

&gt;Technically speaking, there are four “official” religions in Russia: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism. But given that almost 70 percent of Russians identify as adherents to the Russian Orthodox Church, it’s pretty apparent that one religion is more “official” than others.    
&gt;  
&gt;The smallest of the four is Judaism. There are fewer than 200,000 self-identified Jews in Russia today—less than the number of pagans—though the number of Russians from Jewish backgrounds who no longer identify with the religion is likely much higher. They are what remains after a mass exodus that saw more than 2 million Jews leave the countries of the former Soviet Union shortly before and after its collapse, mainly for the United States and Israel. Given that most Russians with Jewish backgrounds range from casual observers to entirely indifferent to their religion, it’s a bit unexpected that their official representatives hail from one of the more doctrinaire sects of Orthodox Judaism. You may be surprised to learn, too, that those representatives are quite close with President Vladimir Putin.    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad members—a small fraction of a small religious community—have become the dominant force in Russian Jewish life.    
&gt;  
&gt;And while there were fears after the fall of the Soviet Union that rising Russian nationalism would lead to an upsurge in anti-Semitism, that never really materialized. “After the collapse of the USSR, the number of cases of anti-Semitism have been steadily dropping on an annual basis over the last 10 years,” says Yury Kanner, head of the country’s largest secular Jewish organization, the Russian Jewish Congress.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever his many other sins, even Vladimir Putin’s harshest critics concede that he’s not an anti-Semite. As the New Republic’s Julia Ioffe notes, a number of his closest confidants, as well as the Judo teacher who served as a mentor and surrogate father, are Jews. He has personally intervened in cases of state anti-Semitism, such as an incident last year in which a teacher was charged with corruption and the prosecution used his Jewish last name as evidence. Putin labeled that “egregious,” and the conviction was overturned soon after.    
&gt;  
&gt;Putin’s has also generally been supportive of Jewish institutions—one Jewish institution in particular. One of the more intriguing aspects of contemporary Russian Jewish life is the close relationship between the Kremlin and Chabad, also known as Lubavitch, the Hasidic sect known in the United States for its street-corner proselytizing to fellow Jews and reverence for the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Founded in Western Russia in the 18th century, the Lubavitchers decamped to the United States in 1940, setting up their new headquarters in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood. The Orthodox Jewish movement has dispatched hundreds of emissaries throughout the world to promote the faith. Just after the fall of Communism and just prior to his own death, Schneerson sent Rabbi Berel Lazar to represent Chabad in Russia.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Adolf Shayevech, a prominent figure in the community since the late Soviet period, was considered chief rabbi until 2000, and still claims the title. Kanner’s group, the Russian Jewish Congress, also recognizes Shayevech. But since Putin came to power in 2000, he has preferred to work with FEOR. Lazar, who is sometimes referred to as “Putin’s Rabbi,” now sits on the country’s public chamber, a government-appointed oversight committee. Lazar has been nothing but appreciative, praising Putin publicly as a friend of the Jews and calling Russia “one of the safest places for Jews in Europe.”    
&gt;  
&gt;In a story that seemed tailor-made to demonstrate the rabbi’s devotion to both his faith and his patron in the Kremlin, it was reported in June 2013 that Lazar had agreed, at Putin’s request, to attend a World War II memorial event hours away from Moscow on a Friday afternoon. When his plane was delayed and arrived back in Moscow just 10 minutes before sundown, Lazar made an eight-hour, 19-mile walk home rather than break the Sabbath. Sources close to the rabbi told the Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva that his willingness to make the difficult journey was an “example of the special connection between Rabbi Lazar and Russia's president.”    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad members—a small fraction of a small religious community—have become the dominant force in Russian Jewish life. “Eighty percent of all synagogues, the rabbis are Chabad,” Rabbi Alexander Boroda, the organization’s chief spokesman, told me in an interview. “But the people who come, many are just young people who want to come and learn something about Judaism.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Boroda dismissed the notion that there was anything improper about his organization’s close relationship with the Kremlin. “The chief rabbi is the representative of the Jewish tradition,” he says. “It’s the Russian tradition, it’s not like America.” Indeed, a number of other Eastern European countries have chief rabbis, and in Ukraine, as in Russia, it’s a disputed position.    
&gt;  
&gt;How exactly has Chabad reached its position of influence? For one thing, it has some influential backers. The Uzbek–Israeli billionaire diamond magnate Lev Leviev was an early and enthusiastic backer of FEOR. Roman Abramovich, the billionaire investor, governor, and owner of the Chelsea soccer team, has also been a backer, donating $5 million to build the Marina Roscha Synagogue.    
&gt;  
&gt;Chabad, which unlike many other Jewish groups is a centrally organized hierarchical organization, also likely looks familiar to the Kremlin. Chabad “replicates in a way the structure of the Orthodox Church,” says Kanner. “There is a center that sends its ambassadors into the communities.”    
&gt;  
&gt;David Shneer, a professor of Jewish history at the University of Denver who was studied the Lubavitchers’ role in Russia, says it also helps that Chabad is a “movement that cultivates ties with political leadership as part of a broader strategy to make a home wherever they happen to be.” He compares this to the medieval practice of shtadlanut, in which European Jews lobbied local rulers for rights.    
&gt;  
&gt;Even though most Russian Jews aren’t Orthodox, Shneer says it shouldn’t be surprising that the Orthodox Chabad has taken on a leadership role in Russian Jewish life. “Chabad is evangelical Judaism,” he says. “They bring Judaism to people at whatever level they’re at. If they want to light candles, they’ll show them how to light candles. If they want to keep kosher, they’ll show them how to keep kosher. They know that 95 percent of people who attend Chabad events are not at all religiously observant. But their point is to bring a certain kind of Judaism to as many Jews as possible.”    
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]    
&gt;  
&gt;Shneer feels that Chabad’s dominance, and the lack of reform or progressive alternatives, is “terrible for the future of pluralistic Judaism in Russia.” Russia is full of people with Jewish or partially Jewish family roots, but after decades of repression and immigration, many have little connection to the religion. On one level it seems unlikely that a branch of Judaism based in part on a rejection of modern society will be the one to bring doubters back into the fold.    
&gt;  
&gt;Kanner, though, says the relative lack of interest in reform or liberal branches of Judaism shouldn’t be surprising, and is rooted in the community’s troubled history. “In Soviet times, we were Jews based on our blood. It was a nationality not a religion,” he says. “The main principle of reformism is that you can be a Jew while also being French or German or whatever. That’s why there was no basis for reformism. In Russia, you are first a Jew, then you are anything else.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Times may have changed and the situation may have improved, but the idea that you can at once be a Jew and a Russian will still take time to take hold.

[The Odd Chabad Connection Between Putin and Trump](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/27/the-odd-chabad-connection-between-putin-and-trump/)  
 

&gt;Three days before the presidential election, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump visited the Queens gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson and, according to The Times of Israel, they prayed for Donald Trump’s victory.    
&gt;  
&gt;Schneerson, who died in 1994, is an interesting character. Although he never claimed it himself, some of his followers consider him the Messiah, and others believe he is still alive.    
&gt;  
&gt;Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known to many as the Rebbe, was a Russian Empire-born American Orthodox Jewish rabbi, and the last Lubavitcher Rebbe. He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century.    
&gt;  
&gt;As leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in world Jewry, with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers. The institutions he established include kindergartens, schools, drug-rehabilitation centers, care-homes for the disabled and synagogues.    
&gt;  
&gt;The Kushner family is Modern Orthodox, and of course Ivanka converted to Judaism prior to her marriage to Jared. Still, according to Ben Schreckinger of Politico Magazine, Kushner was affiliated with the Chabad house at Harvard when he was a student there. Since settling in DC, the couple has reportedly been attending services at a Chabad synagogue.    
&gt;  
&gt;What Jared and Ivanka want to do in their spiritual lives is their business, and I have no intention of casting any aspersions on the Chabad-Lubavitch movement or Rabbi Schneerson. I do however want to explore some things that may circle back to this pre-election pilgrimage to Schneerson’s grave.    
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s begin here:    
&gt;  
&gt;Starting in 1999, \[Vladimir\] Putin enlisted two of his closest confidants, the oligarchs Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich, who would go on to become Chabad’s biggest patrons worldwide, to create the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia under the leadership of Chabad rabbi Berel Lazar, who would come to be known as “Putin’s rabbi.”    
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a good chance that if you know of Roman Abramovich, you know him as the owner of the Chelsea Football Club of the English Premier League. You may not know that he was a victor (along with Paul Manafort’s patron Oleg Deripaska) in the bloody aluminum wars of the 1990s, or that he was reportedly the person who convinced Boris Yeltsin that Putin would be a proper successor. You probably are not aware that Ivanka Trump is very close friends with Abramovich’s wife, Dasha Zhukova, with whom she recently attended the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens. Zhukova reportedly attended the inauguration as Ivanka’s personal guest.    
&gt;  
&gt;It takes a little more doing to understand the Trump family’s connections to Lev Leviev. To begin with, we need to go back to Bayrock, the company that Donald Trump teamed up with to build his Trump Soho project. There were three main actors in that enterprise. One was convicted mob associate and murky FBI informant Felix Sater. Another was Tevfik Arif, a shady man with likely Russian intelligence connections who was once was arrested by the Turks on Mustafa Kamal Ataturk’s yacht and “charged with running an international underage prostitution ring.” The third was the late Tamir Sapir, another man with ties to Russian intelligence. If you’re interested in this aspect of the story, I refer you to my Trump’s Soho Project, the Mob, and Russian Intelligence article and also Mike Lofgren’s piece: Mobbed Up, both written in late February.    
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, all these men have connections to the Chabad movement. Felix Sater was honored as Man of the Year in 2014 by the Port Washington Chabad house. The same Chabad house’s website lists Tevfik Arif, who is not Jewish, “among its top 13 benefactors.”    
&gt;  
&gt;But it’s Tamir Sapir who links Trump back directly to Lev Leviev.    
&gt;  
&gt;Pay close attention to this:    
&gt;  
&gt;…the late billionaire Tamir Sapir, was born in the Soviet state of Georgia and arrived in 1976 in New York, where he opened an electronics store in the Flatiron district that, according to the New York Times, catered largely to KGB agents.    
&gt;  
&gt;Trump has called Sapir “a great friend.” In December 2007, he hosted the wedding of Sapir’s daughter, Zina, at Mar-a-Lago. The event featured performances by Lionel Ritchie and the Pussycat Dolls. The groom, Rotem Rosen, was the CEO of the American branch of Africa Israel, the Putin oligarch Leviev’s holding company.    
&gt;  
&gt;Five months later, in early June 2008, Zina Sapir and Rosen held a bris for their newborn son. Invitations to the bris described Rosen as Leviev’s “right-hand man.” By then, Leviev had become the single largest funder of Chabad worldwide, and he personally arranged for the bris to take place at Schneerson’s grave, Chabad’s most holy site.    
&gt;  
&gt;The man I want to focus on is Rotem Rosen. He is described here as the CEO of Leviev’s American holding company and his “right hand man.” Now, remember that Leviev was described at the top as one of two oligarch’s who Putin tapped to establish the “Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia under the leadership of Chabad rabbi Berel Lazar, who would come to be known as ‘Putin’s rabbi.'”    
&gt;  
&gt;Now, let’s flash ahead to Trump’s trip to Moscow to host the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.    
&gt;  
&gt;After the contest, Trump attended a vodka-infused 1 a.m. afterparty at which ticket holders were promised a meeting with the New Yorker, along with the pageant contestants.    
&gt;  
&gt;He also met with the Agalarovs to talk business…    
&gt;  
&gt;…Joining Trump’s November 2013 meeting with the Agalarovs were Alex Sapir and Rotem Rosen, a pair of New York-based Russian developers who helped to develop the Trump Soho hotel and condominium project in Manhattan.    
&gt;  
&gt;You should know the Agalarovs because they initiated the undisclosed June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Kushner, Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. and a brood of Kremlin-connected conspirators offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in return for sanctions relief.    
&gt;  
&gt;Alex Sapir is the son of Tamir Sapir, brother of Zina, and brother-in-law of Rotem Rosen.    
&gt;  
&gt;Just so we’re clear, Trump hosted the wedding of Lev Leviev’s right-hand man at Mar-a-Lago. Lev Leviev is so close to Putin that he was one of two oligarchs tapped to help him gain control of the leadership of the Russian Jewish community back when he assumed power.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;These are extraordinarily close ties between Putin and Trump and that also connect Trump’s business discussions in 2013 about Moscow real estate projects with the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower that has become one of the strongest pieces of evidence of collusion in the election.

  
[Putin: First Soviet government was mostly Jewish ](https://www.timesofisrael.com/putin-first-soviet-government-was-mostly-jewish)  
 

&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin said that at least 80 percent of the members of the first Soviet government were Jewish.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“I thought about something just now: The decision to nationalize this library was made by the first Soviet government, whose composition was 80-85 percent Jewish,” Putin said June 13 during a visit to Moscow’s Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Putin was referencing the library of Rabbi Joseph I. Schneerson, the late leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The books, which are claimed by Chabad representatives in the United States, began being moved to the museum in Moscow this month.

Zionists have been behind all sorts of things like 9/11 and the infiltration of Hollywood to direct American culture into a more amoral direction. They hide behind Putin and Russia to implement certain goals as well, one of which they've just about completed. The complete takeover of the United States. All roads lead to the Transhumanism agenda for enslavement of the goyim, which is what the Chabad call non-Jews.

The place was near to Vineyard Haven, a large city on the Vineyard, so we decided to walk to it. No one had their phones on them and we got pretty lost. We ended up walking on a street called lake street and we found a letter on the ground. It was unopened, so we decided to drop it in someone’s mailbox and put the flag up so it could get to the person it was intended for. We went up to this lady who was cutting shrubs about a foot away from a mailbox. We asked her if we could put the letter in the mailbox and put the flag up so the letter carrier would get it, and before we even finished talking she said “that’s not my mailbox” we thought this was a little strange, but there were several explanations, so we didn’t think much of it. Then at the end of lake street, we stepped onto a dirt road. When we stepped on we saw a letter carrier almost immediately. We went up to her for directions (at this point we were desperately lost in almost 90 degree heat) and also to let her know about the letter. When we asked her for directions, she continuously grabbed at her head (very hard and seemed to pick at her skin while looking down at several packages and shaking her head) and then said “You walked all the way from Dagget??!!” (One of the street names) she then said she didn’t know the area (she’s a letter carrier she has to know the area!) and then we walked away. We then encountered a boy who asked us if we had Seen a baby, because he was missing one! Finally we walked on this seemingly deserted dirt road with power lines going over the top of it. When we neared the end of the road, a large falcon repeatedly cawed and after that we stepped onto the road that we lived an and we weren’t lost anymore. When we got home, we looked at google maps, and realized the whole time we saw weird people and had weird things happen to us, we were in the middle of a large triangle made by intersecting streets, one of which simply called Power-lines.

**1. What is polio?**  

Polio is a contagious disease caused  by an intestinal virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, and vomiting. Some victims develop neurological complications, including  stiffness of the neck and back, weak muscles, pain in the joints, and  paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases  it may be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.

**2. How is polio contracted?**  
Polio can be spread through contact with  contaminated feces  (for example, by changing an infected baby’s diapers) or through airborne droplets, in food, or in water. The virus enters the body by nose or mouth, then travels to the intestines where  it incubates. Next, it enters the bloodstream where “anti-polio”  antibodies are produced. In most cases, this stops the progression of  the virus and the individual gains permanent immunity against the disease \[1\]. 

Many  people mistakenly believe that anyone who contracts polio will become paralyzed or die. However, in most infections caused by polio there are few distinctive symptoms  \[2\].In fact, **95 percent of everyone who is exposed to the natural polio  virus won’t exhibit any symptoms, even under  epidemic   conditions** \[3,4\]**. About 5 percent of infected people will experience mild sympto**ms, such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and  fever—often diagnosed as a cold or flu \[3,5\]. Muscular paralysis has  been estimated to occur in about one of every 1,000 people who contract  the disease \[3,6\]. This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the  population may be naturally immune to the polio virus \[7\]. 

**Injections:**  Several studies have shown that injections (for antibiotics or other  vaccines) increase susceptibility to polio. In fact, researchers have  known since the early 1900s that paralytic poliomyelitis often started  at the site of an injection \[8,9\]. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed (Figure 1) \[10\]. This was documented in *Lancet* and other medical journals \[11-13\]. In1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain set up a committee to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that individuals are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections; injections alter the distribution of  paralysis; and it did not matter whether the injections were subcutaneous or intramuscular \[14,15\].

**Figure 1. Polio cases skyrocketed after diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced**

Several studies show  that injections increase susceptibility to polio. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed.  This chart shows the average number of polio cases per 100,000 people during five year periods before and after the vaccines were introduced.  

Source: National Morbidity Reports taken from U.S. Public Health surveillance reports; Lancet (April 18, 1950), pp. 659-63.

A 1992 study, published in the  Journal of Infectious Diseases, validated earlier findings. **Children who received DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) injections were significantly more likely than controls to suffer paralytic  poliomyelitis within the next 30 days** \[16\]. According to the authors,  **“this study confirms that injections are an important cause of  provocative poliomyelitis** \[16:444\].” 

In 1995, the New England Journal of  Medicine published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times  more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections.  The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections  within one month after receiving the polio vaccine. And **with ten or more  injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater  than expected** \[17\].  Why injections increase the risk of polio is  unclear \[18\]. Nevertheless, these studies and others \[19-24\] indicate  that “injections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis  \[18\].” Health authorities believe that all “unnecessary” injections  should be avoided as well \[18:1006;24\]. 

**Nutritional deficiencies:**  A poor diet has also been shown to increase susceptibility to polio  \[25\]. In 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin  Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans’ Hospital,  documented a relationship between polio and an excessive use of sugars  and starches. He compiled records showing that countries with the  highest per capita consumption of  sugar, such as the United States,  Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person  per year) had the greatest incidence of polio \[26\]. In contrast, polio  was practically  unheard  of  in  China  (with its sugar use of only 3  pounds per person per year) \[26\].

Dr. Sandler claimed that sugars and  starches lower blood sugar levels causing hypoglycemia, and that phosphoric acid in soft drinks strips the nerves of proper nourishment.  Such foods dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A  serious calcium deficiency precedes polio \[26-29\]. Weakened nerve trunks  are then more likely to malfunction and the victim loses the use of one  or more limbs \[26:146\]. 

Researchers have always known that  polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months.  Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream,  soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In  1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North  Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their  consumption of these products. That summer, North Carolinians reduced  their intake of sugar by 90 percent– and polio decreased by the same  amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases  of polio in 1948, and 229 cases in 1949 (data taken  from North Carolina  State Health Department figures) \[26:146;29\]. 

One manufacturer shipped one million  less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the  publication of Dr. Sandler’s anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down  as well. But the powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen  products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business  leaders and convinced the people that Sandler’s findings were a myth and  the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to “normal” \[26:146;29\].

**3. Can polio be treated?** Paralytic polio is rarely  permanent. Usually there is a full recovery \[30-34\]. Muscle power begins  to return after several days and continues to improve during the next  12-24 months \[30-34\]. A small percentage of cases will experience  residual paralysis. In rare cases, paralysis of the muscles used to  breathe can lead to death \[5:108;30-34\]. 

Treatment mainly  consists of putting  the patient to bed  and allowing the affected limbs to be completely  relaxed. If breathing is affected, a respirator or iron lung can be  used. Physical therapy may be required. 

**4. Does a polio vaccine exist?**  
In 1947, Jonas Salk, an American physician and microbiologist, became head  of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. He was interested in developing a polio vaccine. In 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to “kill” or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease. That year he began his initial experiments on human subjects.  

In 1953, his findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  And in April of 1954 the nation’s first polio  immunization campaign, directed at school children, was launched \[35\].  However, shortly thereafter hundreds of people contracted polio from  Salk’s vaccine; many died. Apparently, his “killed-virus” vaccine was not completely inactivated \[1\]. The vaccine was redeveloped, and by  August 1955 over 4 million doses were administered in the United States.  By 1959, nearly 100 other countries were using Salk’s vaccine \[1,35\]. 

In 1957, Albert Sabin, another American physician and microbiologist, developed a live-virus (oral) vaccine against polio. He didn’t think Salk’s killed-virus vaccine would be effective in preventing epidemics. He wanted his vaccine to simulate  a real-life infection. This meant using an attenuated or weakened form of the live virus. He experimented with thousands of monkeys and  chimpanzees before isolating a rare type of polio virus that would  reproduce in the intestinal tract without penetrating the central  nervous system. The initial human trials were conducted in foreign  countries. In 1958, it was tested in the United States. And in 1963  Sabin’s oral “sugar-cube” vaccine became available for general use  \[1,35\].

**5. Which vaccine is in use today?**  
In 1963, Sabin’s oral vaccine quickly replaced Salk’s injectable shot. It is cheaper to make, easier to take, and appears to provide greater  protection, including “herd immunity” in unvaccinated people.  However, it cannot be given to people with  compromised immune systems \[1,35\]. Plus, it is capable of causing polio  in some recipients of the vaccine, and in individuals with compromised immune systems who come into close contact with recently vaccinated children \[1,35-38\]. As a result, in January 2000, the CDC “updated” its  polio vaccine recommendations, reverting back to policies first implemented during the 1950s: Children should only be given the killed-virus shot. The oral polio vaccine should only be used in “special circumstances \[39-41\].

222,9/11: Solving the Plane/No-plane Paradox,"The no-plane truthers have been accused of spreading disinfo to smear the truth movement. But what if there was another explaination? Having studied all sides for many years, here's what I think happened:

The hijacked planes all went off radar zone for a significant amount of time (why didn't they take the shortest way to the targets, when the ""hijackers"" must have assumed jets were after them and time was of the essence?).

I think they landed the planes in the no-radar zones, killed or threatened whoever was on the planes to stfu. We know a lot of witnesses and firemen have been threatened or killed in the aftermath.

They then used specially designed ""planes"" (or something dressed up as planes), taking off from those same places where the original planes landed, that functioned like laser targeted homing missiles (explains the wierd bright dot on the building right before impact).

If the above is correct, the impact videos showing a ""detailed"" plane are all fakes. Why? 

1) Cause whatever they used did not look like commercial airliners (like some witnesses also claims), and neither does the actual plane we see on the close-up videos. But it ""does the job"", and creates more confusion and ambiguity (good to confuse actual eye witnesses).

2) Cause they knew a certain % would see through - or eventually break free from - the illusion they created (remember, mass suggestion and peer pressure is strong, and eyewitness testimony is very unreliable, and subject to change over time. Not least when the images on TV rolled 24/7, and the nation was in shock which makes everyone a lot more suggestible to the images they see).

They knew that many people would agree on the ""inside job"" aspect, but they also knew some people would understand/see that the planes cannot be real as seen on the video clips. See evidence here: https://yournewswire.com/cia-pilot-presents-evidence-that-no-planes-hit-towers-on-911/ 

In short, look at second impact in slow motion (find it on youtube). A fragile and hollow aluminium plane cannot cut through 14 inch steel beams that covered the towers like a hot knife through butter.  It does not even slow down on impace, just smoothly glides through the heave steel frame and merges with the building. Also, fragile aluminum wings cannot cut cartoonish holes in thick steel beams like that.

It's not a disinfo campaign as many truthers think, it's just a very clever set up to split the truth movement from the very beginning (create infighting). By actually doing it with ""something that looked like planes"", and at the same time faking the imagery (think moon landing. They probably went there, but not with those crappy rockets, and the footage is obviously fake).

Doing it like this is by far the best way for them to do it. It's a win-win. Why?

1) Cause by doing it like this (laser guided missile/planes), they were 100% certain to hit the targets. This is vitally important and often overlooked. Missing targets would be fatal, as damning evidence would be spread all over Manhatten that these ""planes"" were not commercial airliners at all. It would create a crime scene very hard to control and contain, in short, a mess.

2) Chances of hitting the target at that speed and altitude with a real plane of that model would be slim to none (air density/air resistance vs way over max capacity speed = extreme turbulence and the plane would have broken apart before impact. Look it up. Pilots for truth agrees, and so does experienced ex-CIA pilot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9CQ7DtXgc8)

So, to sum it all up. By using laser guided missile/planes chances of successfully hitting targets were close to 100%, while if they used actual commercial airliners the chances would have been very slim. Doing it like this also created massive confusion, and divide and infighting among the truthers. Win Win for them...

223,"From '01 to '05 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Governments had donated to the “Charity”. Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” were declared. Guess who took over this investigation in 2002? None other than James Comey. Isn't that interesting...","# Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?

Lois Lerner.

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?

It gets better, well not really, but this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?

# Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?

None other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?

# Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame?

I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, **Robert Mueller.**

What do all four casting characters have in common?

They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.

Now that’s just a coincidence, right?

Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.

Let’s fast forward to 2009.

James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.

Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.

The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary.

Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to none other than, the Russians.

Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.

However, prior to the sales approval, none other than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid $500 K for a one-hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.

Ok, no big deal, right?

Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.

# Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?

Yep, Robert Mueller.

He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.

# Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland.

# None other than, yup, Rod Rosenstein.

# Guess what happened to the informant?

The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.

How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?

# Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?

145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.

# Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?

None other than, you got it. Lois Lerner.

Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?

Let’s fast forward to 2015.

Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.

He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.

He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.

Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for Hillary.

# Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?

Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer (Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.

**None other than our pal, James Comey.**

Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?

Now he, of course, is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” (after, of course, his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and, of course, exonerates her).

Nope couldn’t find any crimes there.

# Can you guess what happened next?

In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.

They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.

Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016 and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing.

# Can you see the pattern?

It goes on and on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.

FISA abuse, political espionage…. pick a crime, any crime, chances are…… this group and a few others were deeply involved in it.

All the same players.

All compromised and conflicted.

All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.

All connected in one way or another to the Clintons.

They are like battery acid, they corrode and corrupt everything they touch.

How many lives have these two destroyed?

As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.

Let us not forget that Comey’s brother works for DLA Piper, the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation’s taxes.

233,Trump has just laid the seed for acceptance of Russian manipulation in the 2018 midterm elections.,"With [this tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021784726217142273), in particular the line, ""they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats,"" Trump has now seeded the public consciousness with the possibility of Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections.

So, why is this tweet more relevant than any of the other stuff he says?

Back in April of this year, [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-russia-could-steal-the-midterms/) ran a speculative piece on the ""worst case"" scenario for the 2018 midterm election. The scenario is explained in this preface:

&gt;The following is a rendering of what a worst-case Election Day scenario could look like, based on FiveThirtyEight’s interviews with voting and cybersecurity experts and state election officials, along with news reports and documents in the public record.

I cite 538 here because they're one of the most reputable statistical news outlets in the game right now, and of all the various articles, op-eds, and blog posts written about potential election events, I would trust their reputation over all others. They don't write this type of piece very often (their usual work, if you're unfamiliar, reads less like a journalistic expose and more like an academic journal devoted to mathematics), so when they do it's worth noting.

Anyway, Trump's tweet lays the emotional groundwork for exactly the situation that 538 article posits. It doesn't matter if the majority of people see through it as a cheap ploy or distraction, there are enough die-hard Trump supporters out there that this will still put them on track to dispute any election outcome of the midterms that doesn't favor Trump.

This is of course coupled with today's news that Congress has decided [not to extend election security grants](https://www.apnews.com/6580a9fdf5364b46be462d73ed0c5422) leading up to the election. It's a strange thing for them to break from Trump's opinion on, given this Congress' voting history and behavior.

I believe it's becoming more and more clear that there is an intentional effort by Trump and powerful leaders in Congress to keep election security down while sowing public distrust in the results as a means to keep Trump in power, potentially by enacting emergency measures due to an entirely fabricated ""national emergency"" stemming from Russia influencing the upcoming election.

264,[No Meta] Open source investigation: Inter-Parliamentary Union,"Before the United Nations, before the League of Nations, there was the Inter-Parliamentary Union. [Founded in 1889](https://www.ipu.org/about-us/history) by a Frenchman and a Briton, the IPU was established ostensibly to promote arbitration between nations. Originally a relatively informal organization of MPs from various nations, they set up a headquarters in Berne, Switzerland in 1892. 

Given that the League of Nations eventually fell apart and the United Nations is now the preeminent international organization, why do I bring this historical novelty up? Because it still exists 129 years laters and boasts a membership of 178 countries. [(Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union). 

I first learned of the IPU a couple months ago when Truthstream Media [published a short video of the organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hN7CHGGqU).   They found out about the organization from [a 1962 article by Edith Kermit Roosevelt](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/244234570/) (granddaughter of US President Teddy Roosevelt). The IPU received an early source of funding by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. 

Today, the IPU is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and comprises the Assembly, the Governing Council, and the the Executive Committee, with the stated mission to [protect and build global democracy through political dialogue and concrete action](https://www.ipu.org/about-us).  

***

This organization may or may not have any major bearing on current events, but it has been influential in the establishment of both the Hague and the UN. It is one of the first organization (and certainly the oldest extant) directed toward the goal of global governance.

Stanley Bolten,

Bad news, former news reporter of USWGO Alternative News, Brian D. Hill, had lost his Federal Court Appeal over his fight to get access to his own criminal case discovery evidence necessary to prove actual innocence, and that the U.S. Attorney Office committed ""fraud on the court"".

Since Brian is being deprived of true justice, deprived of his Constitutional rights including his right to prove his actual innocence as part of his due process, everybody needs to[ sign this petition at the White House petition website](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/grant-brian-d-hill-uswgo-news-pre-charge-pardon-his-false-guilty-plea-him-prove-actual-innocence) to stop this madness and get Brian some justice in a corrupt kangaroo court nightmare that has affected Virginia, North Carolina, and other states of the Fourth Circuit of the United States appellate district. Brian needs justice quickly.

I have been notified to check CourtListener and discovered two new documents in [Brian's FOIA lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6064365/hill-v-executive-office-for-united-states-attorneys/#entry-71) asking for his criminal case discovery evidence to be able to prove his actual innocence for his Section 2255 Motion under Writ of Habeas Corpus. They even refused to set new case law precedent by making an unpublished opinion, then rubber stamping the Judgment of [crooked Federal Judge Jackson L. Kiser](https://justiceforuswgo.wordpress.com/2018/02/07/federal-judge-rules-criminal-defendant-has-no-right-to-discovery-material-under-foia/) stating that Brian has no right to prove his actual innocence because he will never have a Constitutional right under any means to even be allowed access to the discovery evidence to even be able to prove factual innocence. This is in regards to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The appeal was to challenge the legal opinion and Judgment of Judge Kiser.

What a crooked unconstitutional jerk that Judge Kiser is. I cannot wait for the time when U.S. President Trump appoints a new Judge for the Western District of Virginia, Danville division. Any day when he is ready to retire, good, I hope that Trump can get a good Judge appointed for Danville, Virginia. Hopefully a better Judge that will actually enforce the Constitution of the United States instead of protecting the corrupt crime committing criminal enterprise monopoly of the United States Department of InJustice and the Thuggish Federal Bureau of Investigation. They are all criminals in my book after what they done to my friend Brian, to Donald Trump, and what they have done to other political prisoners. The FBI are DOJ are the Gestapo. They wanted to overthrow Trump and also to continually punish Brian until he goes back to federal prison. They wanted him to commit suicide by their actions and acting as unconcerned that Brian may kill himself if he is permanently blocked from proving his innocence while sitting on the Virginia Sex Offender registry for 25 years over a crime that he did not commit and based on fraudulent evidence that was used to obtain a Grand Jury indictment. None of them will go to prison for the frame up of Brian David Hill, Not one of those bastards will ever pay for their crimes.

Va. Feb. 6, 2018).""* \- Appellate Court decision

No reversible error!!!! No reversible error!!!! What the hell does that mean? A man cannot be allowed Constitutionally to prove his innocence and the Government doesn't have to follow [Ethics Rule 3.8](https://www.ncbar.gov/for-lawyers/ethics/rules-of-professional-conduct/rule-38-special-responsibilities-of-a-prosecutor/) regarding their obligation to turn over any evidence regarding actual innocence to a criminal defendant. I guess they can violate whatever federal law or rule that they want. They can refuse to give any already-known discovery evidence material that can prove the actual innocence. So the Appellate Court is siding with lawbreakers????? Siding with the corrupt U.S. Department of InJustice thugs? They rather threaten Brian with criminal charges or have him at gunpoint by corrupt U.S. Marshals or Department of Homeland InSecurity rather than admit that he is actually innocent. They have no morals, they don't have the moral high-ground. They are as criminal as a gangster or a slew of organized bank robbery, but they are above the law, so why should I be so surprised.

It is unclear whether Brian plans to file a Petition for rehearing, or even a Writ of Certiorari. Knowing how persistent he is, he likely will if he wants to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

This ruling is very concerning, since his main arguments for the U.S. Court of Appeals was that:

1. Brian had properly stated under Oath that he was the criminal defendant of the case which the discovery records of his criminal case were sought, according to the FOIA requests faxed to the U.S. Attorney office. That he needed such records to prove his actual innocence and get his life back and off of the registry once proven innocent.
2. That Brian had been deprived of due process and deprived of effective assistance of Counsel.
3. That Judge Kiser, the crooked Federal Judge, had [threatened Brian with criminal contempt of court](https://justiceforuswgo.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/judge-jackson-l-kiser-threatens-brian-with-contempt-over-asking-for-a-criminal-investigation-into-ramaswamy-sloan/) charge only by asking for a criminal investigation into the U.S. Attorney Office for blatant and fragrant Obstruction of Justice by covering up or destroying the discovery evidence material to prevent their victim Brian David Hill from proving his actual innocence.
4. That as a criminal defendant, he should be entitled to get access to his discovery evidence for his criminal court case to prove his actual innocence to be able to succeed in a 2255 Motion without worrying that it will be dismissed over not having enough evidence to prove his innocence while the Government is blocking him from gathering enough evidence to be found actually innocent.

Thus this sets a new legal precedent where criminal defendants who were railroaded and not allowed to prove their actual innocence, will never be allowed to prove their innocence. Where criminal defendants that cannot obtain their entire discovery packet of evidence for their criminal court case will never be allowed to obtain access to that very evidence to prove actual innocence. Thus everything The Innocence Project has done, has now been in vein. Now nobody will ever be allowed in the future to prove actual innocence in Federal Court if they are appointed a corrupt Federal Public Defender that will refuse to prove the actual innocence of their clients.",conspiracy,1532478203,StanleyBolten,4,28,True,2018-07-24
280,Are Polio Vaccines Safe?,"When national immunization campaigns were initiated in the 1950s, the  number of reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the killed-virus vaccine was significantly greater than before mass inoculations, and may have more than doubled in the U.S. as a whole. For  example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the one-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55  cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after  mass inoculations)–  266% increase. Rhode Island reported 22 cases  during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during  the after inoculations period — 454% increase. In New Hampshire the  figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to  276; and in Massachusetts they  swelled  from 273  to 2027 — whopping  642% increase (Figure 2) \[26:140;29:146;42\].

[Figure 2. Cases of polio increased in the U.S. after mass inoculations](http://vaxtruth.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Figure-2-Polio_thumb.jpg)

When  national immunization campaigns were initiated in the 1950s, the number  of reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the  killed-virus vaccine was significantly greater than before mass  inoculations, and may have more than doubled in the U.S. as a whole.  Source: U.S. Government statistics.

Doctors and scientists on the staff of the National Institutes of  Health during the 1950s were well aware that the Salk vaccine was  causing polio. Some frankly stated that it was **“worthless as a  preventive and dangerous to take** \[26:142\].” They refused to vaccinate  their own children \[26:142\]. Health departments banned the inoculations  \[26:140\]. The Idaho State Health Director angrily declared: **“I hold the  Salk vaccine and its manufacturers responsible”** for a polio outbreak  that killed several Idahoans and hospitalized dozens more \[26:140\]. Even  Salk himself was quoted as sa**ying: “When you inoculate children with a  polio vaccine you don’t sleep well for two or three** weeks \[26:144;43\].”  But the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and drug companies  with large investments in the vaccine coerced the U.S. Public Health  Service into falsely proclaiming the vaccine was safe  and  effective  \[26:142-5\].

In 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used **in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the “principal if not sole cause” of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961**  \[44\]. (The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the  feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and  can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the  virus continues \[45\].) **In 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States** \[36\]. In fa**ct, according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vac**cine \[36\]. Authorities claim the  vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year \[46\].  However, an independent study that analyzed the government’s own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio  vaccine. These reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and  540  deaths (Figure 3) \[47**,48\]. Public outrage at these tragedies became the  impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization sch**edules  \[36:568;37;38\].

[Figure 3. Polio vaccine:  adverse and serious adverse reactions](http://vaxtruth.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Figure-3-Polio_thumb.jpg)

In  the mid-1990s, during a period of less than five years, there were 13,641 documented adverse reactions to the oral polio vaccine. 6,364 of these were serious enough to require hospital emergency room visits. 540 people died. 

Source: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting  System (VAERS); OPV Vaccine Report: Doc. #14

The following story is typical of the damage associated with oral  polio vaccines: “Four months ago my son was taken to a local clinic for his polio vaccine. I wasn’t aware that he was going to have one, and would have prevented it if I had known. Unfortunately, he changed from that day — high-pitched screaming, smelly stools, non-stop crying, difficulty in breathing, high temperature, and lethargy. He also lost  weight. Weeks of sleepless nights for all of us followed. His  development ceased. He had been able to stand and move around, but he  went back to remaining in basically whatever position we left him in.

“My wife was six months pregnant at the time, and about a week after  our son’s polio vaccine, she began to have headaches, loss of balance,  muscular weakness, and frequent tiredness. I panicked because everything  seemed to be pointing to polio infection.  Then, a week after her  continuous headaches began, she had to go to the hospital because there  was something wrong with the pregnancy; she lost our daughter.

“I tried to get a polio test, and to find the cause of this tragic  series of events, but the medical profession was extremely unhelpful.  They laughed at me. I will never know why our son suddenly stopped  growing or why his development regressed. I will never know why we lost  our daughter. The only thing I am sure about is that the precursor to  these events was the polio vaccine.” \[From an unsolicited e-mail  received by the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute—www.thinktwice.com\]

Today, fact sheets on polio published by the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services, warn parents that **the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) can cause “serious problems or even death…**\[49\]”  The  company that manufactures the current inactivated polio vaccine warns that **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**,  a  debilitating ailment characterized by muscular incapacitation and nervous system damage, “has been temporally  related to administration of another inactivated poliovirus vaccine  \[3:780\].” And although this company makes the claim that “no causal  relationship has been established,” it also admits that “deaths have  occurred” after vaccination of infants with IPV \[3:780\]. Yet, like the days of old, despite these “danger alerts,” medical authorities continue  to assure parents that the currently available inactivated polio  vaccine is both safe and effective.

287,"Hacktivism is often controversial. While many decry the use of objectively illegal cyber attacks, no matter how noble the cause, many applaud vigilante hackers like Anonymous and others for taking the law into their own hands.","Brief article on the history of hacktivism. Mentions include: Omega, Cult of the Dead Cow, W.A.N.K., Anonymous, 4chan, Operation Chanology (a campaign against the church of Scientology)

http://www.itpro.co.uk/hacking/30203/what-is-hacktivism

&gt; In a world where hacking has become increasingly prevalent and criminals search for new ways to bring down websites, networks or entire businesses, hacktivism has become a widely used term. In recent years, it's also experienced somewhat of a revival, with activists vowing to take down some political regimes using the power of the internet. 

&gt;But what is hacktivism and is it really an effective way to demonstrate your political or moral stance?

&gt;The moniker was first used by Omega in the mid-90s. Omega was a member of a hacker group known as the Cult of the Dead Cow and was described as the use of computer hacking to express political and sociological beliefs. In some cases, it's more active and will involve attempting to intercept or take down an opposing group.

&gt;Because there are so many reasons to use hacktivism to make an impact, there are also a wide range of methods used to implement it. The most widely used is to bombard a website with fake traffic, known as a DDoS attack, which is designed to take that site down.

&gt;Another method commonly used is the theft of sensitive data that is then distributed on the internet. This could, for example, relate to financial backers in political campaigns, tax records of those that have been involved in suspicious activities or other information a potentially corrupt organisation is trying to keep secret.

&gt;Hacktivism has its roots in the early days of the internet when hackers primarily congregated on Usenet and message boards. Many of these early hackers were motivated by idealism, with a general tendency towards left-wing, anti-capitalist, anti-corporate viewpoints. This, combined with a sense of anarchic mischief and a love of messing with people and systems, spurred numerous hacks protesting various social and political issues.

&gt;Hackers deployed various forms of malware against targets to disrupt their operations, hindering progress by rendering computer systems and networks unusable. An early example was the hilariously named Worms Against Nuclear Killers malware (it's a rather explicit acronym!), which was released into NASA's networks in 1989 to protest the launch of the nuclear-powered rocket carrying the Galileo probe into orbit. The attack reportedly cost the project half a million dollars in lost time and resources, according to officials.

&gt;Modern hacktivism, however, has been defined mainly by the group known as 'Anonymous'. First emerging in the early 2000's, 'Anonymous' was originally the collective name given to groups of users from the 4chan message boards, who would frequently band together to attack targets based on little more than an idle whim. These attacks ranged from relatively harmless pranks, such as ordering numerous pizzas to someone's house, to more vicious attacks such as carrying out DDOS strikes against websites or doxxing people.

&gt;What makes Anonymous unique is that it has no formal membership, controlling body or internal structure. Anyone can participate in its operations at will, and the targets and attack vectors it picks are determined by popular consensus amongst its members and fans. In its early days, Anonymous wasn't overly focused on political or ideological issues, preferring instead to target internet personalities that its members felt needed to be taken down a peg or two.

&gt;The group's first real foray into hacktivism came in 2008 when the group began a campaign of attacks against the church of Scientology. Operation Chanology, as it was known, included a week-long DDoS against the church's website, along with physical protests outside various Scientologist properties. The adoption by protestors of the Guy Fawkes mask from cult graphic novel V for Vendetta, incidentally, is what led to its now-iconic status as a symbol of hacktivism.

&gt;Following Project Chanology, Anonymous has also been heavily involved in various campaigns to foil attacks on internet freedoms. The group mounted significant efforts to fight the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), both of which were accused of being efforts to censor the web. In more recent years, the group has been carrying out persistent attacks against the online arms of terrorist group ISIS, targeting websites and social media accounts used to spread propaganda.

&gt;Hacktivism is often controversial. While many decry the use of objectively illegal cyber attacks, no matter how noble the cause, many applaud vigilante hackers like Anonymous and others for taking the law into their own hands.

&gt;An excellent example of modern hacktivism at work is the attack on extramarital dating site Ashley Madison. A group calling itself Impact Team stole the personal information of 37 million members from the site, with references to users as ""cheating dirtbags [who] deserve no such discretion"" indicating that the attack was at least partially motivated by moral concerns.

363,This new-age marketing is getting extremely sophisticated: American express sharing my purchase info with ebay and amazon?,"So tonight I went into walmart and I bought a pack of q-tips, some tums, and some dog shampoo using my amex card. They didnt have the body wash I use, so ONE HOUR after going to walmart, I decided to go check for it online. In my 'recommended' beneath my shopping page on e-bay there were listings for q-tips, antacids and you guessed it- dog shampoo. I have never purchased any of these items online before, but here they were on my 'recommended.' The card I used at walmart is the same card I have saved on my e-bay account.

I guess i figured amex might be sharing my purchase info with potential marketers, as to what stores I might spend money, but I never thought they could share the EXACT ITEMS purchased, or that this would be compiled by e-bay so quickly. Makes me wonder what kind nefarious marketing triad may exist betweeen walmart, amex and e-bay. It pisses me off that amex is finding new ways to monetize my personal purchase information without benefiting me in any way. If they are going to get paid from this info (which I assume they are) then they should at least offer me extra rewards points or discounts for shopping with their 'preferred merchants.'

Anyway, I just found this to be very surprising when I saw the items I had just purchased at my local walmart show up in my 'recommended' on my e-bay page. I'm not usually one to make the 'slippery slope' argument, but the implications of this and the potential for abuse and privacy invasion are unsettling to say the least.

370,"A list that was made over 4 months ago that perfectly describes the take over, vote manipulation, and forum sliding that is attempting to make reasonable discussion on this subreddit completely impossible.","A long list of the CTR shill tactics I have observed on r/conspiracy. I also believe that both sides of the debate use these tactics. But it should be obvious by now that only one side has the current funding and power to have rigged every aspect of the reddit-machine in their favor.

__________

* They will buy aged accounts from places like this: https://www.epicnpc.com/forums/1277-Reddit-Accounts. Google the following key words to see more of these sites: “buy reddit accounts AND forum”. 

__________

* They will organize in secret subreddits and discord chats. They use the largest subreddits they mod as recruitment HQ’s. For example, there are mods in TopMinds that also mod large anti-Trump subreddit.

__________

* There are a handful of usernames in r/conspiracy that clearly move with their own upvote/downvote gangs. I assume these users represent the alt accounts of power users in the anti-Trump, CTR, “resist” community. Every comment they make is upvoted to double digits and every opposition comment is downvoted the same way, usually within the first 20 minutes. These users *never* post about non-political conspiracies. 

__________

* They have a list full of usernames that they spread amongst their trolls. They mainly target people who are well-spoken and who source their comments. These users are the biggest threat to them because they can persuade multiple others users with facts over emotions.

__________

* They are afraid of facts and want people to stay blinded by emotion. This is why they mainly focus on brigading threads attached to scaremonger headlines (which the MSM has an endless supply of). They love yellow journalism and work very hard to spread it to as many people as they possibly can. 

__________

* They predominantly want to associate various “off-limits” conspiracy theories with a negative implication. The go-to at this point is Trump, since he is a very polarizing person (multiplied many times over by the constant brainwashing of the MSM).

__________

* By constantly connecting those “off-limit” conspiracy theories with the idea that only “Trump supporters” believe them, they can easily change the entire comment section into a tribal shit-slinging fest while the real conspiracy gets ignored.

__________

* They mostly rally on the talking point that everyone who isn’t supporting their narrative is a Trump supporter. This works because it attracts the support of people who are not necessarily shills, but who understandably don’t like or support Trump.

__________

* They will accuse you of being a Trump supporter, or a Russian, for attempting to find the grey area, playing devil’s advocate, or not emotionally reacting with blind hate towards all things anti-Trump / anti-Russian. They desperately need to keep these two topics connected because it is one of the foundations of the Trump evil/traitor/imposter/treason narrative.

__________

* They will forum slide your comment section by stringing together a coordinated comment chain. They almost always run with the narrative that “conspiracy is right wing/TD/pro-government/Trump.” 

__________

* They try very hard to associate Trump with “the Establishment”, “loving/defending the government”, “TPTB”, “pedophiles”, the list goes on… Everything negative that they can stick to Trump helps the efficiency of the tactics stated above.

__________

* They will comment a variation of “whataboutism” and “changing the subject” whenever someone, for example, mentions that the US *also* has a troll farm in a thread about Russia using troll farms. Their gang will upvote them and downvote you for using whataboutism. 

__________

* But at the same time, they aggressively and constantly use whataboutism, for example, by mentioning that the Russians have a troll farm in a thread about the US using troll farms. Their gang will upvote them for using whataboutism and downvote you.

__________

* They will comment a variation of “Hillary isn’t relevant anymore” in order to distract from any conversations about Trump being the lesser of two evils. That conversation would water-down the basis of Russia investigation, which would then take away from a major anti-Trump talking point.

__________

* They will downvote every comment an OP makes in his own thread, to frustrate him and make him associate posting with being punished. If the OP notices this behavior and attempts to expose it through comments, the more people are called in to downvote/attack him.

__________

* They will fictionalize your posting history, like saying that you constantly post in TD when you have never actually posted there. They know very few people will check.

__________

* They will respond with long lists of links that are copypasta from anti-Trump subreddits. Those links will have zero regard for accuracy, many or all will be opinion pieces, and many or all will have unreliable or anonymous sources. Also known as a ”Gish gallop”. 

__________

* They will mass upvote any comments that distract from well-sourced and relevant comments. This includes pun comments, sarcastic comments, and one-liners.  

__________

* They will intentionally provoke you right on the edge of personal attacks, waiting for you to say the wrong thing back. Then they will hit the report button and message the mod who is on their side. That mod will ban you.

__________

* They have “kamikaze” alt accounts that will come at you aggressively with swearing, insults, and behavior that will surely lead to a ban. They hope that you will be emotionally trigged enough to come back at them. Then a mod will ban both of you: their throwaway and your real account.

__________

* They will intentionally hit all of the report buttons in a thread. Making it hard for a good mod to search for the real violations over the fake ones.

__________

* They will scream that “The Donald” is taking over the subreddit, a distraction where you accuse your victims of exactly what you are actually doing, while you are doing it. They will scream this regardless of what the vote tallies indicate.

__________

* They will scream that “The Donald” or ""the alt-right shills"" or ""the Russians"" will surely not allow their thread to get any traction. They will scream this even while their thread is on the front page with a 90% upvote score.

__________

* They will pretend to be stupid, so that you get frustrated and waste your energy on them.

__________

* They will ignore essential concepts like degree, scale, level, magnitude, extent, and scope. For example: both my brother and the Empire State Building are tall. They will apply this ignorance of ""degree"" to all topics.

__________

* They will ask for “sources” for things that will require hours of work to put together and present, like “show me a source that r/politics changed”. Even if you put that work in, they would simply dismiss it.

__________

* They will use alt accounts to say things like “I was a Trump supporter but I changed my mind…” or “I used to believe in the Seth Rich conspiracy but I changed my mind…”.

__________

* They will use alt accounts to say things like “The Jews did 9/11 with a spaceship” to make the subreddit look crazy.

__________

* They will argue with their own alt accounts and “win” the argument. But one user is both of the accounts. It is a scripted show.

__________

* They will erase the history of an alt account that has been banned and then repurpose it as a “creepy PM” account that will privately harass targeted users.

__________

383,"Watching vs Seeing: Introduction to understanding psychotronics through ""un-TV"" Part I","#Introduction

This is a discussion I've considered starting for a while now. I have seen many people on here mention the hypnotic nature of television or other aspects of the Spectacle. This post will be focusing on TV almost entirely. This is because out of other mediums, TV has had the most longevity. Most of the people who are active in the Modern World today can't remember a time before television. Their childhoods were deeply influenced by television, and this has no doubt had an effect on our world at large. 

Internet-based mass media is beginning to replace TV, and that will undoubtedly bring its own set of consequences. Nonetheless, today I would like to focus on those sizzling tellies which have been such a big part of this Age of Decay. It's worth noting that I actually did not grow up with a TV. When I tell that to people, many of them are surprised, thinking it's a sign of poverty or some sort of bizarre neglect. My parents were completely debt free and financially independent, they loved my siblings and I very much. However, we never had any sort of TV growing up. 

We never particularly wanted one, we had plenty to do to entertain and/or better ourselves. This may strike you as a sort of pretentious boasting, a sort of arrogant pride in authenticity. I'm not after authenticity or naturalness just for the sake of both those things. I choose to examine and distinguish objects and actions not according to any intrinsic value but according to their opportunity in view of physical and metaphysical reactions. It's not about me being better than you or having something to brag about, it's about finding a way of living that can get us out of the current metaphysical exile we're in. 

I mentioned the word, ""psychotronics"" in the title and I would like to define it. Psychotronics means the use of technology, particularly electronics, to influence the thoughts, emotions, and memories of people. In other words, the technological modification of consciousness. You'll see people use it in slightly different ways, referring to particular technologies or concepts. It was my father who taught me when I grew up about the nature of television and its psychotronic effects. A lot of what you'll read on here is based on what he taught me. Other parts of it are based on the work of authors such as Marshall McLuhan, Jerry Mander, both are people's whose work I recommend you read. 

You may recognize some of the stuff here because I am aware that there are a couple other write-ups on the topic. I've also collaborated with people in the past to discuss this topic and raise awareness on other sites. With that being said, let's begin with what exactly un-TV means. 

#The Act of Un-TV 

When I refer to, ""un-TV"" I am talking about reversing the Electric Master-Organic Slave dynamic that is so common with television. The, ""Spectacular"" forces of TV usually conquer the individual, but through un-TV you are able to turn the tables. It is the opposite of how TV is meant to be used, therefore it becomes un-TV. It's counterintuitive for anyone who has been attached to the savage landscape of the Modern World for too long, and you'll think it's all ridiculous at first, but for those who are willing, it can be a truly amazing process. It just might unlock other realizations for you. 

The essence of un-TV is simple, do not *watch* TV, *see* TV. Instead of being passive, choose to be active. Granted, how easy it can be to be passive. Isn't that the allure of the medium? The ease of letting the programming flow into your unresistant senses and into your mind? One can see the subtlety, television becomes a world unto itself which you can get sucked into. Older mediums possess this kind of ability on a smaller scale, even books, but TV is truly a master at the craft. Of course, for the purposes of un-TV, let us go against passivity and into activity! Provoke yourself into stopping this world by stopping the television. 

See TV through cultivating awareness, mastery, and organization in its presence. Rip the mask off and scrutinize the naked face. My father compared this to Odysseus wanting to hear the sirens' song, but insisting on being strapped to the mast of his ship while he does so. I mentioned Jerry Mander earlier, and he had a very good idea for a mast. He called them, ""technical events"" (TE) and he dubbed the act of counting them the, ""technical events test"" (TET). Mander distinguishes, ""pure"" television with television that has technical events. Once any sort of television program contains a technical event, even a single one, it becomes impure even if its only slight. 

According to him, pure television (PTV) is the output of a stationary, ordinary, and unfiltered camera and microphone simply recording what it is recording. There's no changes to the lighting, no special effects, no sound effects, no background music, no panning, no zooming in/out, no transitioning, no overlaying, nothing like any of that. Anything that gets in the way of PTV is a technical event. Chew on the implications of that for a bit. Even the most dry of C-SPAN broadcasts switch cameras to denote when someone is speaking. Not to mention the text that is no doubt superimposed on the screen. Albeit, perhaps C-SPAN has more purity than other scheduled programming, but nonetheless there are TE to a tee. 

The TET is simple, see TV, and count the TE. Every time a technical event happens, count it and make a note of how long you've been in front of the box. Anything that happens on the TV counts, even the commercials, *especially* the commercials. How many TE do you count watching 30 minutes of the evening news? How many do you count watching children's programming? How many do you count watching a documentary? If you'd like you could even make a quick note of *what kind* of TE occurs. Later on, you should certainly try to interpret *why* the TE were put in there? What message was being sent to the viewers? What thought(s), emotion(s), memory(s), and/or archetype(s) were being piped to those within its grasp? 

Another big part of TV is altogether removing aspects of the experience. Turn off the sound and watch it for a set amount of time, say 20 minutes. I've heard someone else insist that it should be exactly 15 minutes but the point is you should set an amount of time and stick with it, even if its absolutely boring. Again, experiment with different flavors, news programs, dramatic programming, children's programming, etc. You may feel like it's a waste of time, quite frankly you might become uncomfortable, like staring your flaws in the face. 

#Conclusion

I am ending today's post a bit short. I have the second portion of the introduction to un-TV already written up. However, I will be posting it the same time tomorrow. For now, I want you to more or less do the experiment I've outlined and then comment the conclusions you come to below. I don't want to spoil any further revelations you may experience for yourself. It would be even more helpful if you give us a copy of how many TEs you counted, what you were tuned to on the TV, and the general specifics of what happened. 

Tomorrow I will expand more on what can be learned through un-TV. For now, I want you to try to come to that knowledge and wisdom on your own. Again, put your thoughts below if you do the experiment, or merely discuss it, perhaps you've even done something like this before. Maybe you'll even want to do it on mediums that aren't explicitly television, but behave in a similar way i.e. a constant stream of visuals and sounds channeled to the viewer. It's ultimately up to you. I will see you tomorrow, and I wish you all the best of luck.

397,The Missing: Dennis Martin - strange disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8QZ0kNUhsk&amp;list=LLGM8WNwdmx76qhqYSRlYYxw) popped up in my youtube feed a few days ago about a boy who disappeared in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee in 1969. It's pretty damned interesting, and it seems that people disappearing in this park under unusual circumstances is (or was) not uncommon, and there is evidence of a coverup.

Here is the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Dennis_Martin), and I found several interesting articles on these strange vanishings (here are a couple: [part 1](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2016/08/vanished-into-thin-air-at-the-great-smoky-mountains/) [part 2](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/06/some-very-strange-information-on-the-bizarre-vanishing-of-dennis-martin/)), and [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8QZ0kNUhsk&amp;list=LLGM8WNwdmx76qhqYSRlYYxw) I watched is very good.

The youtube video description has a decent tldr, pasted below:

ATTENTION! If you visit National Parks, watch this video. Find out what National Park Services don’t want you to know.

The Missing 411 series began when David Paulides received an anonymous tip from an off-duty park ranger while Paulides was working on some periphery research in a national park. The ranger expressed some concern over the way the National Park Service had been handling some of the missing persons cases in their parks, and he suspected that the National Park Service was not acting in complete integrity with regard to disclosing information about people who go missing in their parks, and asked if Paulides would be willing to research this concern. Paulides obliged, and has since uncovered hundreds of missing persons cases, primarily in national parks and wilderness areas, the characteristics of which fit a specific profile.

The missing people documented in these cases fit the following profile:

* Missing people are often found in areas previously searched.

* Missing people are documented as having traveled impossible or highly improbable distances for their age and physical endurance level.

* Missing disappear in the presence of their dogs. Sometimes, searchers only find the dog.

* Trained police bloodhounds, and K-9 units brought to the scene of the disappearance are either unable to pick up a scent trail, or will lie down and not want to track.

* Inclement weather such as rainstorms and windstorms strike immediately after these disappearances, severely impeding search efforts.

* Missing people disappear in the late afternoon, most commonly between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM Missing people are found near the perimeter or in the middle of a swamp or briar patch.

* Missing people are found in an unconscious, or semiconscious state.

* Missing are found with one or more items of their clothing removed, without apparent reason to have done so.

* Law enforcement and family members are often quoted stating that they believe kidnapping or foul play has occurred.

Any thoughts on this? Is this old news? This specific case is 50 years old, but this is the first I've heard of it (I also found no hits on a search for ""Dennis Martin"" within this sub). What could they be covering up here?  If it were just ""feral men"" who lived in the forest, why would they cover this up?

432,Patents You Should Know About: Entry 1,"[Crowdsourcing Sound Captures to Determine Sound Origins and Predict Future Events. ](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=49&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=Cloud&amp;OS=Cloud&amp;RS=Cloud) 

Basically, this is the technology that Large companies use to buy or sell data and information about *you.* Companies like Facebook will have this technology implemented into their apps, which you will opt in to use through their terms and conditions. 

This technology passively manipulates the microphone on devices that have opted into using this service. Say that you attend a baseball game, the technology will connect your device with other around it to record the surrounding sounds. Then using data from the sound given, and data from the mobile device, the technology can tell exactly where you are in space and time and predict where you will be going or what activities you will engage in  in the future. If it records waves crashing and see's you're at the beach or live near the beach, it can predict that most likely you spend your times out doors and it can predict which beach or area you are likely to go to in the future. 

This technology is obviously what is used to push sales and ads on you. We've all seen the posts about people talking about cat food or something and then a few days later their phones are showing nothing but ads for cat food and supplies. What's disturbing is that this data is made open to the public, but only available to those willing to pay for it. This is literally the technology used to keep a data base on **you.** This is how big business only sees you as a consumer and what they can sell you. Fucking insane. 

**Key Points:**

 . A method comprising: identifying, by one or more processors, multiple mobile devices for crowdsourcing a sound capturing activity; receiving, by one or more processors, sounds captured by the multiple mobile devices; analyzing, by one or more processors, captured sounds to determine a location of a source of the sounds; identifying, by one or more processors, a date and time that the source produced the sounds; identifying, by one or more processors, a temporospatial sound pattern for the sounds based on the location of the source of the sounds and the date and time that the source produced the sounds; plotting, by one or more processors, the temporospatial sound pattern on a digital map, wherein the digital map depicts the location of the source of the sounds while the source produced the sounds; predicting, by one or more processors, a recurrence of the sounds generated by the source based on the temporospatial sound pattern plotted on the digital map; and modifying, by one or more processors, a hardware system based on the predicted recurrence of the sounds produced by the source.  

 Examples of events that can be predicted based on previous sound patterns include, but are not limited to:   


Traffic patterns--where an absence of noise or presence of sounds at a specific decibel level can be used as an indicator of a current, and thus future, traffic state;   


Sporting event concession--where the captured sounds indicate fans cheering, which may be used as a predictive indicator of a food and beverage sales increase;   


Nature watching occurrence--where the captured sounds are used to predict the presence of a certain type of animal (e.g., a mourning dove) at a particular time and location based on historical sound data; and   


Sporting activity conditions--where the sound of captured sounds (e.g., a pounding surf) can be used to indicate optimal or poor conditions for certain sports (e.g., surfing, fishing, swimming, etc.) in the near future 

 Thus, the present invention provides a method for crowdsourced sound capture and analysis to determine sound location origin, and to be able to search the location on an electronic map in order to predict events and optimal occurrences of entities that are emitting certain sounds. That is, one or more embodiments of the present invention provides a method, system, and/or computer program product for capturing sound intensity, decibel levels, and sound direction from crowdsourced mobile devices (e.g., mobile devices 151 shown in FIG. 1). The sound data and location are streamed to remote server(s) (e.g., computer 101 shown in FIG. 1) to perform an analysis to determine the location of the sound's source/origin. The sound's origin and sound data are plotted on an electronic map to visualize the sound data for a given location, date and time.   
 

 Users register their mobile devices with a remote system, such that the remote system identifies these mobile devices as being available for sound crowdsourcing captures. For example, consider FIG. 2, which depicts multiple mobile devices 251 (analogous to the mobile devices 151 shown in FIG. 1) positioned in various physical locations. In one or more embodiments, mobile devices 151 are cellular phones that are modified to continuously and passively listen for sounds, which are captured from mobile device microphones (e.g., microphone 117 shown in FIG. 1 when incorporated into the architecture of the cellular phones), converted into digital audio files, and streamed in real time (or alternatively are stored and periodically burst-streamed) to a remote cognitive server (e.g., computer 201, which is analogous to computer 101 shown in FIG. 1).   


In one or more embodiments, the mobile devices 251 communicate with each other, in order to: 1) locate certain sounds (i.e., compare the relative intensity and temporal differences of a particular sound being captured by the various mobile devices 251 in order to triangulate the location of the source of that particular sound); and/or 2) provide peer-to-peer suggestions and/or directions to turn specific mobile devices on and off, depending on the location of the specific mobile devices (e.g., direct a mobile device that is physically closest to the source of the particular sound to turn on its microphone, in order to capture the cleanest copy of the sound).   
 

 Step 1: Capture Sound Data using Crowdsourcing Passive Listening Mobile Devices   
Multiple non-co-located passive listening mobile device microphones within a physical region (surrounding) receive sound from the surrounding region, and identify local properties of the local sound (i.e., intensity, decibel level, direction, etc.). The location, date and time data are also captured with the sound data. Thereafter, each mobile device in the surrounding region captures (stores and/or streams to the computer 201 shown in FIG. 2) the sound and calculates the local properties of the received sound such as the local intensity, loudness (i.e., decibel) and direction of the sound.  

 Step 2: Calculate Sound Source Origin   


The participating mobile devices collaborate with each other based on their proximity to the sound source. The implementation of how to calculate the possible source origin can be done using a collaborative model from mobile devices, or receiving and performing analysis at the remote cognitive system. That is, the analysis of the sound data can be performed locally by one or more of the mobile devices 251 shown in FIG. 2, or this analysis can be performed by computer 201 on sound data (audio file, time stamp, location stamped, etc.) received from one or more of the mobile devices 251.   
 

 Step 3: Analysis of Historical Sound Data   


The system then performs an analysis of historical sound data gathered on the remote server (e.g., computer 201 shown in FIG. 2) to categorize sounds, look for patterns and correlate with other events and occurrences.   


For example, assume that a user is interested in hearing the call of a mourning dove. In this example, the remote server (e.g., computer 201) will predict when and where a user and/or mobile device 251 is most likely (or best able) to hear the sound of a mourning dove's call in the future. To do so, the system first categorizes the type of sound (i.e., bird calls, specifically mourning dove bird calls). The system then correlates the captured sound with other events. This can be dynamic learning or static mapping defined in a table. For example, in the case of monitoring the call of mourning doves, the sound of mourning dove calls may be associated with ornithologists who like to hear bird calls. The system analyzes historical occurrences of the mourning dove call (using past data collected by the mobile devices 251) to determine patterns for future occurrences. For example, based on previous occurrences of mourning dove calls, the most likely occurrence of future mourning dove calls may be in a certain park at a certain time of day.  

 In one or more embodiments of the present invention, the system analyzes historical occurrences of sounds to identify external factors that influence patterns for future occurrence. For example, weather may influence when a sound can be heard. Combining predicted upcoming weather (""it is going to rain tomorrow"") with predicted best time/location to hear sound (mourning doves are quiet when it rains) may predict that ""tomorrow"" may not be a good time to listen for mourning doves.   


In one or more embodiments of the present invention, the system analyzes other data sources to find a source of a particular sound. For example, an image analysis of pictures on social media may show a flock of mourning doves in a certain park. Analyzing photograph time stamps indicate the birds are most prominently found in this park at 6-8 am each day.  ",conspiracy,1532542533,BlazedLarry,14,55,True,2018-07-25

Anyway, this is not a post about the Mandela Effect.

* We had a [partial eclipse of the sun](https://www.space.com/41115-solar-eclipse-above-antarctica.html) this month, on Friday the 13th, visible from parts of Antarctica, Tasmania, Australia and a very narrow slice of New Zealand. 

* Another partial eclipse of the sun will take place on Aug. 11; it will be visible from northern Europe as well as a large portion of central and eastern Asia.

* Between the two solar eclipses, on July 27th (in two days), there will be a total eclipse of the moon. It will be a blood moon, and the **longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century**. It will be visible from Europe, Africa and Asia (it will be daytime in North/Central America and the moon will be below the horizon).

Now to the conspiracy aspect:

Last Friday (July 20th) in the Russian arctic, [locals were frightened](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/992331/Russia-news-Yakutia-blackout-devil) when they were unexpectedly plunged into sudden darkness. It lasted for three hours, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

&gt; The sun was not visible in the two neighbouring districts but no other area of the Yakutia republic reported the cataclysm.

&gt; “We wondered if this was an eclipse, but it can’t be something witnessed only by two districts.""

This [is being expained](https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/sun-blanked-out-in-arctic-siberia/) by a ""cloud of dust"" from distant wild fires that must probably have stopped, hovered and then landed over the Eveno-Bytantaisky and Zhigansky districts.

&gt; We took torches to walk outside, but actually no-one wanted to be on the street because the feeling was as if something heavy in the air was pressing on your chest’, said one resident. 

&gt; After the sun returned, locals found  thick layer of dust covering everything outside.

&gt; Normally before any eclipse air temperature drops by 3,4 degrees centigrade, and true, that morning was cooler than usual. 

&gt; Neither Eveno-Bytantaisky, nor Zhigansky district were close to the wildfire areas, and air was completely still on the morning it happened.

Don't blame me for thinking this is weird.

If these events are connected, and if they mean anything to the occult powers, what could that meaning be? I am not suggesting TPTB are influencing heavenly objects; rather that they might see them as auspicious.

My own conjecture is that it [ties into the Shemitah/Jubilee.](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ieq96/trumps_jerusalem_announcement_fulfills_the/) This is the last of ""blood moons"" that had been connected to it. Friday the 13th is a very important date to Templars and associated cults (on Friday, 13 October 1307, King Philip IV ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested, and the Knights Templar organization disbanded - that is the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition).

You are the coach of a baseball team. You are in the championship game, 9th inning. You have the choice of two pitchers to choose from to win the game. One pitcher is a has questionable morals outside field. He is a womanizer, treats people like dirt, bullies random people, born with a silver spoon, etc. While you also have the choice of the other pitcher. Outside the field, he is an outstanding person, treats people in kind, humble and quiet, a regular person. 
One pitcher has been on a winning streak the entire season; three game no-hitter. Where on the other hand, you have the pitcher who is decent at best, will cost the game on the first pitch at worst. As a coach who wants to win the game, who do you put in?


I know people are going to take this analogy out of context. But, regardless of if you are pro-Trump, or Anti-Trump, this is a way to better understand your perspective and others. 

This is why the mainstream media's approach to attacking President Trump's personal activities will never dissuade Pro-Trumpers. This is also why talking about how good President Trump's policies are will never change the mind of a Anti-Trumper- as they are looking at his private life, not as a representative of the United States. 

The takeaway- If you're a Anti-Trumper and are trying to change the mind of 'the other side', then talk about his policies. If you are a Pro-Trumper, change their mind by discussing his personal virtues. ",conspiracy,1532548119,A_solo_tripper,31,0,True,2018-07-25

I hope mods are ok with this discussion.

I woke up yesterday, started browsing reddit and found my user account on a list of accounts to be harassed.

Mods (of other subs) and users were encouraging harassement and brigading of accounts of users that have spoken out about James Gunn and Dan Harmon.

I visit and post in r/the_donald and I am not part of any claimed ""organized"" effort. I object to being harassed for voicing that [James Gunn](https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr) and Dan Harmon [NSFW](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1532293518224.webm) should not be supported for normalizing child rape and paedophilia.

**Where was the Admin team?**

A mod of r/MarchAgainstNazis r/bestoff intentionally ignored site wide rules and gleefully encouraged targeted harassment of users yesterday.

Ironically those claiming to ""March Against Nazis"" are the ones engaging in Nazi tactics.

I was brigaded and harassed all day long.

The toxicity on Reddit is becoming ridiculous. The majority of the hyperpartisan toxicity including harassment, vote manipulation, and brigading is being stoked and fed by paid astroturf connected to subs created to spread hate about Donald Trump (and Bernie, r/EnoughSandersSpam). These people stalk users, label users, bully, silence, and prevent civil discussion while encouraging others to join in.

They create lists of users, encourage others to tag them with RES, link topics to other subs, then publicly harass, and downvote with bury brigades.

It's brown shirt tactics.

The admin team has done nothing to clamp down or stop it.

This is not what Aaron would have wanted.


**Meta discussion** (about Reddit)

I post in r/the_donald (and also in r/conspiracy) because it's actually a place where civil dicussion can happen (unlike r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics). Those subs have been influenced heavily by paid messaging, brigading, and vote manipulation, with interests connected to the Democrat Party. It's an echo chamber and not a place for open debate or balanced information.

Look at the r/worldnews mod team. There are over 10 users on that team who mod astroturf subs with NGO connections or political subs directly controlled by one political party. Want to guess which party?  The mods don't think it's a problem.

Since Bernie lost the primary much of Reddit has turned into a shitpile even the non-political subs. The vote manipulation and guilded posts are not fooling anyone. Algorithms to silence trump supporters also isn't fooling anyone. Paid astroturf is ruining reddit.

Two seasons ago in Homeland s06e10 (""sock puppets"") they had a boiler room type scene depicting NGO paid astroturf.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EufH0T196bY 

Admin, mods, and some users might not realize it, but the level of manipulation, harassment and propaganda is driving people toward Trump, not away from him.

The Democrats have no message other than Russia, Russia, Russia, hate Trump.

BTW, I voted for Bernie, not that it matters.

463,Is this what Putin really has on Trump ? Answer from quora reposted with permission.,"The fact Trump has had affairs is not really related to what dirt Putin has on Trump.

Mostly, the financial issues -After his sixth bankruptcy, no legitimate bank would loan Trump any more money. (Would you?) With most banks, they cease after one, or two, at least for seven to eleven years. Trump wanted and needed cash, so beginning way back in 1998, he began to take loans from (cough cough) less legitimate foreign banks. That continues, to this day.

Most of those foreign banks were sham banks set up by Russian Oligarchs (who are also member’s of Putin’s Government) — often to launder money from the Russian Mafia around the world.

One, though, is not. But, it is a “very dirty bank.” It is Deutsche Bank. They play a game which is illegal in most nations, and a violation of international banking laws. They set up special divisions, which allow customers to put money into the bank, and then make their own loans back out, and it appeared to be a “Deutsche Bank Loan.” (It was not, of course, and this is more money laundering).

The Deutsche Bank loans Trump took out were for money from those same Russian Oligarchs — Putin’s friends who are a part of Putin’s government today.

Deutsche Bank was caught, finally, and many nations leveled fines and sanctions against them. Finally, the Bank was hit with the single largest fine in the entire history of the world:

 From 1923 to 1953,  before the Salk killed-virus vaccine was introduced, the polio death  rate in the United States and England had already declined on its own by  47 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Source: International  Mortality Statistics (1981) by Michael Alderson.

The standards for defining polio were changed when the polio vaccine  was introduced. The new definition of a polio epidemic required more  cases to be reported. Paralytic polio was redefined as well, making it  more difficult to confirm, and therefore tally, cases. Prior to the  introduction of the vaccine the patient only had to exhibit paralytic  symptoms for 24 hours. Laboratory confirmation and tests to determine  residual paralysis were not required. The new definition required the  patient to exhibit paralytic symptoms for at least 60 days, and residual  paralysis had to be confirmed twice during the course of the disease.  Also, after the vaccine was introduced cases of  aseptic meningitis (an  infectious disease often difficult to distinguish from polio) and  coxsackie virus infections were more often reported as separate diseases  from polio. But such cases were counted as polio before the vaccine was  introduced. The vaccine’s reported effectiveness was therefore skewed  (Table 1 and Figure 5) \[52,53\].

The fact that dubious tactics were used to fabricate efficacy rates  was corroborated by Dr. Bernard Greenberg, chairman of the Committee on  Evaluation and Standards of the American Public Health Association  during the 1950s. His expert testimony was used as evidence during  Congressional hearings in 1962. He credited the “decline” of polio cases  not to the vaccine, but rather to a change in the way doctors were  required to report cases: “Prior to 1954 any physician who reported  paralytic poliomyelitis was doing his patient a service by way of  subsidizing the cost of hospitalization… two examinations at least 24  hours apart was all that was required… In 1955 the criteria were  changed… residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of  illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset… This change in definition  meant that in 1955 we started reporting a new disease… Furthermore,  diagnostic procedures have continued to be refined. Coxsackie virus  infections and aseptic meningitis have been distinguished from  poliomyelitis… Thus, simply by changes in diagnostic criteria, the  number of paralytic cases was predetermined to decrease… \[52:96,97\]”

472,Interesting Context on the Removed Question and Putin's answer in the Trump/Putin Helsinki News Conference,"Okay, so it seems damn clear that the White House ***knowingly and intentionally*** omitted a rather important part of a question asked of Putin (and Putin's answer) from the *Official Transcript* of the Helsinki Press Conference. 

Is this a big deal? ***Hell yes!*** Or, at least it should be. I mean, look at the implications! It seems to be the ""Smoking Gun"" that could VALIDATE the accusations of ""Russian Meddling"" that have haunted this country since the election.

We're used to having our sleazy politicians LIE to us and hide the truth, but it's usually not so godammn in-your-face. 

But is there more to this story?

It seems that some important context -- *spoken by Putin only moment's earlier*, has been overlooked by virtually media sources (or at least those that I have seen).

**But first, the SMOKING GUN:**

[***According to the Atlantic***](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/trump-putin-press-conference-transcript/565385/) and others, the following statements were altered/ partially omitted in the White House version:

**QUOTE** (Bolding in original - reporter's words in italics):

**** 

&gt; &gt; Vladimir Putin: That could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.

&gt; &gt; **Jeff Mason: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?**

&gt; &gt; Putin: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.–Russia relationship back to normal.

&gt; *And here’s the key section from the White House transcript, which makes it seem as though Putin is still talking about the Mueller probe:*  

&gt; &gt; PRESIDENT PUTIN: That could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.

&gt; &gt;** Q: And did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?**

&gt; &gt; PRESIDENT PUTIN:  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.–Russia relationship back to normal.

&gt; *Another strange wrinkle comes from the Russian government’s English-language transcript of the press conference. In contrast to its footage of the press conference, which features what really happened, the transcript does not include any piece of that key exchange.*

****

**END QUOTE**

That's some shady looking shit right there folks. The way I see it, there is ***and can be no excuse*** for the White House' behavior -- especially when ""ERROR"" in the WH version of the transcript had been pointed out DAYS EARLIER yet *remains uncorrected*. WTF?

Add to this the fact that the Kremlin's version seemed to MIRROR &lt;l&gt; RORRIM this omission, and it's little wonder that ***Conspiracy Theories*** *(yes that's exactly what they are)* abound - insisting that Trump and Putin are ***colluding*** in a sneaky-sneaky way... ***and they may well be!***

But before I ramble on further, **HERE IS THE CONTEXT** that I mentioned above, as quoted from a [July 17th translation published by **VOX**:](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference)

**QUOTING THE TRANSCRIPT** via VOX (emphasis is mine):

****

&gt; &gt; PUTIN: **As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed: you can trust no one. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact.**

&gt; &gt; There are issues where our postures diverge and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. **We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion?** This is utter nonsense — just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there’s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That’s usual thing.

&gt; &gt; ***President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia/US relationship and it’s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it and different people could express their sympathy in different ways. Isn’t that natural? Isn’t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?***

* [...]

* **[Now re-read the question and answer below in light of Putin's above statement]**

&gt; &gt; REPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): **President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?**

&gt; &gt; PUTIN: ***Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US/Russia relationship back to normal.***

****

**END QUOTES**

Here's a screen shot of the relevant paragraphs [**from the Vox transcript**](https://i.imgur.com/5nzAzFW.png)

So, does context of the statement preceding Jeff Mason's question shed some light on Putin's ANSWER to that question? Well, for ME it does: GIVEN THE CONTEXT, Putin's answer was *nowhere near* any ""admission of guilt"", and does not seem to be the ""Smoking Gun"" as portrayed by Rachel Maddow and others... (you may see things differently)

**HOWEVER** that does NOT explain the ***creepy sneaky behavior*** of the White House in OMITTING portions of Mason's question - OR that the Kremlin version (allegedly) mirrors that omission, does it?

No matter how you slice it, the White House has some EXPLAINING to do.

487,"Alright. Enough is enough, TMOR: a message to all disinfo agents currently active here and a call to arms.","In the recent days, it has come to my opinion that the disruptive activity of certain members of /r/TopMindsOfReddit here is becoming unbearable. Political trashposts looking like they come from a leftist propaganda site, mostly in the comments but also in the top level (look at the recent “assasination news” of the feminazi that committed suicide), are filling /r/conspiracy and distracting from the actually important news. A false flag operation aiming at turning this subreddit from a serious site for discussion of paranormal and other non-mainstream topic to a laughable tinfoil hat wearer convention is underway. Propaganda against the free-thinking conspiracy community is being spread not only on TMOR but also in the media. 

I believe that these attacks are intercoordinated. TMOR admits that multiple world powers operate so-called “troll factories”, instantly demasking itself as one. Look at the TMOR front page. 50 percent of the posts are sh*t, the rest is rubbish. Just like the recent articles in the mainstream media portraying the newest Novichok false-flag operation and the Siberian Day of Darkness, but even more nonsensical and immature. As another user of this sub recently said, no smoke can appear without fire. Yet the mainstream media, whose internet arm consists of /r/TopMindsOfReddit and similar “communities”, tries to prove the “scientific” explanations ad absurdum. The storyline of the newest poisoning incident can easily be recognized as eerily similar to a faulty Hollywood plot, and yet “intelligent” people think Russia did it.

**It is enough. Anybody from TMOR who reads this is kindly asked to spread the following message to their sub:**

On behalf of the community of /r/conspiracy, I hereby point out that they are **not welcome here**. Our subreddit has always been a place for free thinkers and the exercise of free thought. No matter how unconventional or fantastic a theory is - it is welcome here. It can be disproven in healthy debate, but it should always be given a chance. Only the mainstream media, the lying propaganda machine calling itself “The Press” is not welcome here.

Even though political conspiracies can be intriguing and are nonwithstandingly the most common type of conspiracy theory and were always given the opportunity for civil discussion here, they shall not be abused as tools of disruption. This subreddit is a haven for all interested in the paranormal, in extraterrestrial life, explanations of unexplained or incorrectly explained phenomenona, in UFOs and secret military programs.

Do not take us for dumb. We can easily spot classic propaganda and disinformation. The leftist, feminist post is full of it. We know how a staged discussion looks. We know how to spot an alt. We know how to spot a bot, even a sophisticated one. We know how to spot a mole or a sleeper agent.

I hereby demand that this **undeclared war** is stopped before consequences arise. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth - shall your attempts at mocking persist, the power of the free internet will be unleashed onto your laughable, idiotic spinoff of a 4chan SJW board. The only thing that keeps us from fighting back is our kindness and compassion, our belief in God and His commandment to forgive the sins of others.

male characteristics like courage, patriotism and determination. Yet when it comes to actually acting in such ways around other people, I find it kind of hard. When I face a problem at work, I think about showing confidence in the face of adversity yet even adults won't tolerate such behaviour. I can't speak for females, but I was wondering if it was the same for you when trying to show off your feminity? It's almost like many of the things that a person could call an ""identity"" or ""persona"" are being attacked. Humour is used in a lot of the media people are exposed to in order to normalize psychological abuse and eventually, people become too scared like to try out different things out of fear of being ridiculed.

It's not just gender identities. Even moral, religious, cultural and national identities are being attacked through ridicule.

Since a lot of men can't act the way our brains are wired to work, they end up becoming frustrated and cynical towards society and stop trying to fix it. The constant violence people are exposed to
surely makes things worse since they are also likely to become mentally unstable. Personally, after trying out many types, I chose a stoic personality since it allows me to keep myself and others under control. I'm not the type of person who can trust someone right away, I need to know what their motivations are first. But since creating that kind of bond is difficult in the modern, accelerated age, I rather keep distance from others. The constant attacks on the ""personas"" surely doesn't help either, so by being stoic I can both keep people away and yet have power over them at the same time. By practicism healthy amounts of stoicism I can act ""manly"" and have power over others this way. I think that because of the isolation people are exposed to in the modern age, this kind of role model is needed for people to develop healthy personalities instead of so much attention being given to politicians and celebrities.",conspiracy,1529775935,HibikiSS,90,25,True,2018-06-23

35,Austin Texas legalizes petty crime.,"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-austin-freedom-city-2018-story.html

One of the new city resolutions requires officers who question immigrants about status to also say that their questions about immigration need not be answered. The other resolution directs police to avoid arrests for misdemeanors, including those for smoking marijuana, having drug paraphernalia, and taking part in petty theft — crimes that city data shows frequently end in arrests of black and Latino residents.

While Austin is among the country’s first so-called freedom cities, it’s part of a wider movement around decriminalizing low-level offenses and decreasing arrests. According to Local Progress, a national network of progressive city officials, some council members in El Paso and Dallas are also considering “freedom city” proposals.

“Poor people of color in our city are over-punished and over-incarcerated,” said Greg Casar, an Austin City Councilman who pushed for the resolutions. “If people are being arrested less, we can also prevent people from being put in the deportation pipeline.”

“We found that black and Latino residents comprised 75% of discretionary arrests for driving with licenses invalid in the city even though they are 45% of the population of the city,” Casar said. “Black residents are seven times more likely to be arrested for low-level marijuana violations despite having comparable rates of usage of marijuana to white residents.”

Casar said the new rules could prevent up to 1,000 low-level arrests each year. Austin police arrest around 30,000 people a year.

Austin’s new rules passed Friday after more than 100 residents spoke about them at a City Council meeting. While support was wide, groups differed on the need for the “freedom city” title, and what effect it will have.


S.s. People of color cannot commit crime in a white supremacist society I.e. Texas. They are not committing crime when they steal or do drugs in public, no. Those actions are in fact self defense against institutionalized racism in our country. To arrest someone for a misdemeanor only helps to enforce racist stereotypes.

49,The Pyramid Ramp Pump Theory and the Denisovans,"A user here (cannot say name due to rules) has discussed with me the potential for the Pyramid to be a ram pump. This is a paraphrase of what he/she said:

Pyramid= big ram pump allowing the generation of an extremely low frequency ELF connecting to the Schumann resonances. This is what I learned about Schumann resonances:
&gt;Lightning discharges are considered to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate electromagnetic energy at frequencies below about 100 kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies.
 
The person think that those resonances can offer some expansion of consciousness for all living beings on the planet (At least that's what I got from it).
&gt;The Schumann resonances are oscillating magnetic frequencies that happen in the Earth’s electromagnetic spectrum. They are said to be generated by electromagnetic changes that happen within the earth’s core, that then affect the earth’s surface, and ionosphere, including the sentient beings living upon it. This resonance has been about the same for hundreds, if not thousands of years, but it seems to be changing. Why?

Person compares it to a cloud system where data is stored and transferred eventually to conscious beings? Person mentioned 'dark energy' and how it can be transferred across galaxies.

This is what I could gather about dark energy:
&gt;Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: ""empty space"" can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster. 

Now I'm not too sure I could interpret what the user said, but a TLDR is that the pyramid acts as an amplifier to raise consciousness across the globe and work as a communication device across galaxies if it is pointed to a specific spot. Kind of like operating a radio and picking up a station. I'm probably wrong. It's hard to put this into a simplified version and I don't understand it perfectly well.

Now I see people stating Sirius and Anubis are part of the Ancient Atlantean past and they may sometimes introduce aliens into this theory. I think this is part of a conspiracy that is in fact distracting us from the true history.

When people talk about Sirius, they are indirectly referring back to Sumer. Sumer is **not** the birthplace of civilization.

&gt;Since Sirius is the Dog Star, let us turn to the dog-headed Sumerian goddess Bau. According to Thorkild Jacobsen,1 'Bau seems originally to have been goddess of the dog and her name, Bau, to have constituted an imitation of the dog's bark, as English ""bowwow"".* Bau was also the daughter of An. So here the dog-goddess is the daughter of An, whereas in Egypt the dog-god was himself An-pu (Anubis).

You might think, oh but Sirius is not connected to Sumer. Think again.

&gt;Since the fifty Anunnaki were children of An, and Bau is a daughter of An, it is not far-fetched to see in Bau a survival (for she is an old goddess who faded into obscurity in later times) of the concept of a dog-star goddess equivalent to his as Sothis. And it is interesting that she was dog-headed. For Anubis was not entirely a jackal or dog, he was merely jackal- or dog-headed. 

And this is very interesting as well.
&gt;The Sumerian Bau, as a daughter of An, is a sister of the fifty great gods (Anunnaki) who are also children of An. Since Bau may be a goddess of the Dog Star Sirius, the fact that she is the sister of 'the fifty' is significant, as Sirius B has an orbital period of fifty years.

I think people are trying to bring it all back to Sumer, to Gilgamesh, and to Babylon. And these are lies.
&gt;This is thus yet another dog-motif connected with fifty (Sirius being the Dog Star), and linked to Sirius in various ways, such as through the goddess Hekate as an underworld version of Sirius. (The fifty Sumerian Anunnaki also had their counterparts in the underworld. Fifty in the underworld as 'death-counterparts' or shadows to fifty in heaven makes one hundred - the very meaning of Hekate.) 

The truth lies in the Denisovans.

They seem to be the blonde, white, and blue-eyed giants that were seen and talked about all over the world.

&gt;We do not know how the Denisova hominines looked but as mentioned: A tooth found in the cave was very large, so they might have been very tall. We know that people in the area surrounding the Altai Mountains in the 6th to 3rd centuries BC had a very advanced technology; a race of white skinned, blond, blue eyed and very tall people with Caucasian features and long skulls. 

&gt;The divine kings, the ""Gods"", of Egypt were often depicted as white skinned, blond, blue eyed and very tall people with Caucasian features and a long skull. Were the ""Gods"" of the ancient Egyptian king-lists in fact Denisovans? Not us homo sapien sapien but our archaic cousins the Denisova Hominins?

They are the missing link to learning the true history, the ancient history (30,000+ years), and the Atlantis mystery. To understand their origins, their technology, is to resurrect a golden age and an end to this hell. 

Last thought: I hypothesize that the Atlanteans were a Denisovan-human hybrid because Denisovans if they were giants, could only thrive in cold climates. A user provided a theory of Square Cube Law and human height. Saying that the colder it is, the better off a form will be if it is taller. The hotter it is, the easier it is to cool down being short. As we know, the world got warmer at the end of the last Ice Age. What if in order for the Denisovans to survive, they had to breed with humans? Thus a hybrid species existed. Melanesians have the highest percentage of Denisovan DNA and they have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Welcome to the Discussion. Let's talk about DMT and Psychedelics. A lot of us are familiar with DMT, magic mushrooms, and the like, however, what many people do not know is that DMT naturally occurs and is found within the human body and throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well.

Now why would something that is naturally made within us, be outlawed? Is that a law on consciousness? Or is it a profitable control mechanism?  Why not both? Divide and conquer? You choose! The real truth is, it is total bull shit that DMT, a naturally occuring compound, is a schedule 1 ""drug"", by that measure, they see our bodies as a serious threat to our own safety. WHAT. Sounds more like our liberated consciousness is more of a threat than DMT is itself. DMT has the potential to liberate you from the chains of social conditioning and mass brain washed consumerism mindset most are trapped in. We have been MKUltra'd on a large scale and on top of that divided against each other and painted all different labels, boxes, and shapes. Magic mushrooms alone and DMT have the ability to transform the way you see and intrepid reality. That in itself is a different thread, but I really wanted to highlight the total BS that is making a naturally occurring compound found within the human body a schedule 1 ""drug"". 

Some examples of the drugs that are on each schedule:

    &gt;Schedule 1: marijuana, heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and magic mushrooms
    &gt;Schedule 2: cocaine, meth, oxycodone, Adderall, Ritalin, and Vicodin
    &gt;Schedule 3: Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone
    &gt;Schedule 4: Xanax, Soma, Darvocet, Valium, and Ambien
    &gt;Schedule 5: Robitussin AC, Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, and Parepectolin

In general, schedule 1 and 2 drugs have the most regulatory restrictions on research, supply, and access, and schedule 5 drugs have the least.

https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6842187/drug-schedule-list-marijuana

You have an easier time doing research and studying the effects of tylenol with codeine than you could marijuana, DMT, or magic mushrooms. The body even has a endocrine system for cannibinoids! Yet these are all schedule 1, meaning the most regulatory restrictions on research, supply, and access.

Do you see the picture I am painting?

Our bodies have been outlawed, and profited off of, and then thrown in jail and made to be a slave. This is an extreme example but it truly tells a story of what laws and legislation has done to us at a global and national level. It is 2018. And we are only just now reversing the fuck up of the war on drugs through the legalization of cannabis. What a slow fucking roll. Humanity is a slow species in my opinion and it kind of pisses me off at times. We have so much potential yet continue to bog ourselves down with unneeded bullshit.

98,Is the gay rights movement a plot to stop overpopulation?,"DISCLAIMER: This post is not intended in any way to villify or defame people who identify as homosexual, love whoever you want.

Okay, so I have a question. While I was scrolling through some gay rights article that popped up on my feed, I noticed an interesting trend. Many LGBTQ+ activists seem to be advocating for the end of a society that presses what they call heterosexual norms on our youth. This includes stuff such as forbidding male/female sleepovers for dear of heterosexual sexual relations between the children, and the usage of language like ""your future wife"" or ""future husband"". I think this is interesting, because at the surface it seems like a fairly normal thing to push for, so that LGBTQ+ kids growing up don't feel so outside the norm, especially with new data showing that the majority of young people nowadays don't self-identify as straight. But I think there may be some other motives. Almost 3 decade ago the world seemed to be gripped in a widespread fear of overpopulation. There were several books on the topic, and the idea was that it was such a threat to our society that references to the dangers posed by overpopulation worked their way into the public conscience. However, much of the science and data that circulated during that time have been rendered obsolete by the widespread use of genetically modified crops. They solved the problem of feeding the hoardes of people that were supposed to be around by the end of the 21st century. So the reason why I think there may be a connection is partly because many liberals are opposed to GMOs and because the gay rights movement is predominantly liberal. I think that it might not be too far fetched of an idea for a group of people to come up with the idea that if they were able to make a large percentage of the population open to the idea of having sexual relations in a way that does not produce children, they could slow down the effects of overpopulation. Now, the evidence for this is shaky at best and has no likelihood of ever being proved correct, I think there is a few compelling arguments to be made here. One, there have been a few studies that show that being gay is often heavily influenced by the environment that you grew up in, I think this article sums it up ok:
 http://www.bu.edu/today/2010/nature-vs-nurture-the-biology-of-sexuality/
The reason this is important is because if being gay depends on you having exposure to the idea of homosexual relationships, then the widespread acceptance of non straight people nowadays could account for the huge numbers of young people who are identifying as homosexual. It could also be because of the desire to be a part of a community, or a marginalised group, giving more power to the individual because of intersectionality, but that's a theory for another day. The second piece of evidence for my theory is that in the 1970s, the book ""The Population Bomb"" by Paul Erichle was causing a worldwide fear of population. That book is often credited for starting the idea of overpopulation, and it caused widespread panic. The book was published in 1968. Just one year later was the Stonewall Riots, the event that is often credited as starting the modern gay rights movement. It could be a coincidence, but we don't really do that here. So yeah, that's my thing. Sorry about spelling and grammar errors, sort of a late night thought.

114,Xxxtentacion isn't actually dead.,"After keeping up with his story and watching all of his interviews in the past, this stuff is starting to oddly add up. I'm too lazy to go back and find the interviews and the IG posts where all of this was said, but if you want to go find it for yourself, godspeed. In one IG Live video, he predicted his own death of being shot. In another interview with DJ Akademics, he mentioned if he were to die, no one would be there to lead the youth. This isn't the only weird thing. In another interview right after he got out of jail, he mentioned he wanted to make a comeback video of him waking up from a casket to show that hes still alive but a part of him died inside when he was in jail. The thing that makes me really look up to Jahseh was his intelligence, despite his history. At a mere 20 years old he really understood the music industry. He stated in the same interview with DJ Akademics (i think it was the same interview) that he is finessing the rap game by making music that fits all people, even if he himself doesnt approve or like the music. But the reason he does it is to pull all of these people in so when he makes REAL music, like he did with the 17 album, he would gain a larger and larger following. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you think about it all, he faked getting shot, he is going to either A: Wake up in his casket at his OPEN CASKET FUNERAL or B: Use all of the people that have started listening to all of his music to listen to his unreleased music when it comes out and profit off of it. I mean its so genius. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, this is just a theory/conspiracy but I mean, hes showed his genius in the past but you heard it here. I admire Jahseh alot and I've always loved his music and it really, REALLY hurts me to see him go. Thats why I've dug and dug to the point of where I've convinced myself that this is all a setup.

This I present for the sake of hypothetical consideration, to motivate a person to question EVERY belief they have.  These are not my opinions but I give them as perspectives to consider to get outside the box in which most of us are enslaved.  Think of different perspectives which might apply to the concepts below, even if it makes you angry or frustrated to do so.

* Cancer is a deadly disease and extremely expensive and difficult to cure; it is caused by environmental factors.
* The network news, whichever network one watches, is a journalistic, open-minded, representation of the truth.
* The only way to succeed in American society is my going to college and/or hard work.
* Belief in prayer or healing is like believing in magic.
* As Americans, we live in a free society and have an inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

In order to be free, you must question everything by going to the very core of your being.  The truth does not reside in the constant media assault we live under but comes from within your heart.  You need to turn  your TV, smartphone and any other device off for a day, then a week and see how your mood changes during that time: see how your outlook on life changes and see how what you perceive as the TRUTH changes.  Can you possibly form and IDEA which is uniquely your own?

How this doesn't add up.

This area borders Israel and Jordan.

We all know the current administrations level of support for Israel.

We know US troops are staged in Jordan, and have used this border to introduce trained rebel troops into Syria.

This area is critical to Israel establishing a deeper buffer zone into Syria to protect the Golan Heights area that Israel and Genie Energy are currently exploiting of its natural gas and oil...the contracts are already signed...and infrastructure for these operations have already begun.

Israel is currently pushing another vote within the Golan Heights area to get Syrians there to become Israeli citizens.

https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/syrians-golan-heights-boycott-israel-election-area-180619180933900.html

139,British version of Operation Mockingbird? BBC travel Presenter also an SIS asset?,"Hi Conspiracy friends, I have something very speculative to discuss, or rather to ramble about; I'm definitely not accusing anyone of anything definitively.

How many of Britain's news and media personalities are MI5/6 assets? Is there public knowledge of a contemporary program similar to America's [Operation Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)? We know, from [recently released documents](http://archive.is/qB1cZ), that the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Security Service (MI5) have had a long, controlling relationship and that BBC applicants were vetted to make sure they would tow the establishment line; clearly MI5/6's own agents would have passed this secret vetting process with flying colours and would have been waived through to influence the masses via state TV programming. 

[An MI5 logo from pre-1955 logo](https://i.imgur.com/9ekU4Xw.gif). 

[BBC's first TV ident/logo](https://i.imgur.com/e3Nqi9K.jpg). 

[SIS logo](https://i.imgur.com/YtTTpac.jpg), we could go deep on the symbolism of SIS/ISIS/ISrael that the elite's Hidden Hand seem to have a fetish for, but let's stay focused on the topic at hand! Here's [MI6/SIS's Babylonian Temple](https://i.imgur.com/O3jVjCE.jpg) which is believed to tunnel deeply under the River Thames (also known as '[The Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isis)')


I was thinking about this today because I was watching a [YouTuber's response video](https://youtu.be/BeWbIj2PHnE) to a BBC travel show by one 'Simon Reeve', who I will endeavour to describe my suspicions about. This was ostensibly a travel documentary, but it definitely continued the western media establishment's propaganda campaign of painting Russia in as negative a light as possible. Again, I must stress that I have no proof one way or the other so please take it with a pinch of salt and do nothing with this information except consider it for what it is. 

[Simon Reeve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reeve_\(British_TV_presenter\)), in his capacity as the BBC's go-to documentary travel broadcaster has filmed over 100 programmes and travelled extensively in more than 120 countries. This strikes me as perfect plain-sight cover for an MI6 plant who needs to travel the world.

His list of [globe-trotting programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reeve_\(British_TV_presenter\)#Television) exploits for the BBC are extensive, initially making '[Meet the Stans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reeve_\(British_TV_presenter\)#Meet_the_Stans_\(2003\))' where he visits Central Asian countries and towards the border with Afghanistan. 

Before his career with the BBC on television, in 1998 he wrote a book about Al Qaeda, 'The New Jackals':
&gt; ""Reeve states that they were a new breed of terrorist, militants with no restrictions on mass killing. Reeve concluded that by 1988, the world was entering a new age of apocalyptic terrorism; Reeve predicted Al Qaeda would launch massive attacks on Western targets."" 

This narrative aligns with, and acts as useful propaganda for what the western intelligence agencies were planning in the late 90s up to 9/11, 7/7 and beyond. The 'War on Terror' was largely engineered by western intelligence assets arming militant Islamist groups and with false flag operations, as they continue to do today in places like Syria and elsewhere.

&gt; ""Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the book was republished with a new epilogue, which warns the West remains vulnerable to further attacks, possibly from biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction.""﻿

In 2004, he was allowed to film a documentary in the British/western puppet state of Saudi Arabia, '[House of Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reeve_\(British_TV_presenter\)#House_of_Saud_\(also_broadcast_as:_Saudi:_The_Family_in_Crisis\)_\(2004\))'. 
&gt; ""Participants ranged from Saudi princes and Islamic militants, to teenage girls and Osama bin Laden's former best friend.""

He began his media career as a teenage postboy for 'The Sunday Times' broadsheet, a deeply entrenched establishment propaganda machine; then bizarrely he almost immeditately moved into investigating terrorists and other intelligence-type activity way above his station. From his [official bio](http://archive.is/2p2l#selection-663.292-687.263)):
&gt; Still in his teens, he sorted the mail during the day, and began researching and writing in his spare time *[independently, or with the help of MI5?]*. His 'big break' came when he found two foreign terrorists on the run in the UK, and he began conducting investigations for the newspaper into subjects such as arms-dealing, nuclear smuggling, terrorism and organised crime. By the age of 19 he was a staff writer on the newspaper, one of the youngest ever. *[More evidence that his career has been, helped?]* 
&gt; 
&gt; Over the next few years, Simon traced and interviewed 'Afghan Arabs' and close friends and supporters of Osama bin Laden, along with senior FBI, CIA, and Asian intelligence officials. Simon had clandestine meetings with spies and militants in tea houses, car parks and burger bars, was followed by secret agents from at least two countries, and worked undercover in disguise while searching for a former Lebanese arms smuggler. Traveling across three continents, Simon obtained classified documents and evidence detailing the existence, development and aims of the most dangerous terrorist organisation in modern history.
&gt; 

This certainly reads more like the activity of an intelligence operative, not the activity of a postboy hastily turned reporter. My theory is that he was recruited in London by MI6 after being caught doing something criminal as [part of a bike gang](http://archive.is/O6sos#selection-1915.284-1915.543) ('join MI5/6 or face prosecution' type deal). This would explain how he ""miraculously"", as he puts it, got a job at 'The Sunday Times' and was so suddenly thrust into investigating such intense intelligence associated activity in meeting spies, terrorists and intelligence officials. I'm not saying he's a gun-toting James Bond super-spy, since working for the BBC he has probably done nothing more than exchanging packages and intel from other assets and things like that as he travels the world for his filming. Thames House, the MI5 building is less than a 5 minute walk from The Sunday Times' offices.

&gt; [To begin with](http://archive.is/O6sos#selection-2103.204-2103.514) I was unsackable *[at The Sunday Times]*. I was a devious lad. Then I began offering myself for little missions and jobs. Suddenly I was going off looking for terrorists in the Midlands. 

He was arrested by the KGB in 2004 for spying, before being quickly set free once the KGB realised who he was, ['How the Queen of England saved Simon Reeve from the KGB'](http://archive.is/okrJA#selection-1091.0-1095.25):

&gt; “I was filming a secret Russian base there. The police were real KGB. Luckily, I’d told my guide that my claim to fame is my vague relation to Sir Christopher Wren, who apparently everyone in the Soviet Union learnt about in school. So our guide turned up at the KGB offices, saying ‘What are you doing? He is a relative of the Queen of England! There will be huge trouble for our country!’ and I was quickly released. They even gave me a KGB cap as a souvenir,” Reeve reportedly said.

I wonder if he has an MI6 hat as part of his real work uniform to go along with his KGB souvenir? [Sir Christopher Wren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren#Freemasonry), the architect behind much of London's post-Great Fire symbolic architecture is believed to have been a (Speculative) Freemason (before the secret society 'came out' in the symbolically chosen year of 1717).

It's up to you to make your own decisions about who you trust in media and most of his documentaries are seemingly innocent, well put together travel shows. I just thought this was food-for-thought that many of the personalities presented to us may not be what they seem and the security services may have their tentacles more tightly wrapped across the spectrum of society, including media to keep control of the important narratives (such as the 'War on Terror' narrative and the 'demonise Russia whenever you can' narrative).

His book was integral to forming the Al Qaeda narrative to engineer the false flag 9/11 operation leading to all the chaos we now see in the Middle East (which has contributed to the migrant crisis and everything else we're seeing now):

&gt; In 1993, Simon began studying the first World Trade Center attack just hours after the bombing. While investigating the background and origins of those responsible for the 1993 terrorist strike, Simon discovered more terror attacks were being planned by a disparate group of militants connected to the bombers - a group now commonly called al Qaeda. 
&gt; 
&gt; Simon's research and conclusions formed the basis of his first book The New Jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama bin Laden and the future of terrorism. Published in the UK and USA in the late 1990s **it was the first book in the world on bin Laden and al Qaeda**. **The New Jackals warned al Qaeda was planning huge attacks on the West, and concluded an apocalyptic terrorist strike by the group was almost inevitable**.

193,Money for nothing!,"The driving force behind American society is money. People plan their lives around it, 

and it plans out peoples lives. Someone is considered to be successful, not by how hard he works or by how happy he is,

but by how much money he has made. Americans lust over it so greatly that most criminal actions are committed in

an attempt to get more of it. The captivating beauty of cupidity determines the course of peoples lives, 

shapes what companies produce, and decides who is going to be the next president.

So many people today labor under student debt, mortgages and an uncertain pay flow from employers.

Something which has resonated strongly with me were the words from Star Trek First Contact:

As Captain Jean-Luc Picard explained, ""The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. 

We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.""

With our society so focused on money as a growth factor what I've witnessed is that many people, and myself to

an extent have become afraid of money or even loathesome of it because money creates false assumptions. 

In addition to creating assumptions, money also develops an interpersonal fixation; 

fixation on money as an object develops infatuation in the pursuit rather then the outcome.

The fixation creates an individual whose life is defined by his/her job and no longer by what their passions 

might be. No longer is success defined by how happy we might be or where we are in life but rather

Success in society is based on material wealth leading people to always want more then they already have, 

creating the problem of over consumption, and over consumption and being American go hand in hand. We waste

just as much as we create. Technology is continually updated driving us to want the newest, coolest thing out there.

60&amp;#37; of the waste is outdated technology suggests that people rely too heavily on technology and consequently rely 

too heavily on money to constantly acquire and upgrade these goods. 

Money serves to control people’s lives. Money only gives the illusion of power to the person who possesses it. 

Another thing I often hear and heard every once in a while from my family was the line ""its nice to have nice things"",

and I can't go against that logic. It is nice to have nice things, very nice in fact and even more so 

convienent. So one has to wonder whether its simply nice to have nice things, or if its nice to have them because

they make out lives more convienent then they were before. Technology has done this for us.... we've bought in

to the premise that technology makes our lives simpler, and while this is true to some degree, we can't 

underestimate how much more complicated its made things as well. Technology only exists because there is 

a drive for money that forces people to continually update and upgrade the things they already have. 

Because people are left with no choice and cannot halt the process, people are really under the control of money. 

All of this begs the question, if a monetary reward wasn't at the end of the tunnel when creating new technologies

would we still strive to create, strive to explore, strive to discover? I'd like to answer yes, but I'd only be 

answering for myself and a small percentage of society I think it through. Society is based around 

the accumulation of money. It is what drives a person's assumptions, fixation, environment, 

success, control, and aspirations..... aspirations you say? yes indeed, money serves to place a limit 

on the aspirations of people because in order to achieve their goals they need to attain a certain level 

of financial security. As we strive for personal wealth and status based upon money we must understand, that

unlike you, money does not care about what happens to a person, yet the person cares about what happens to the money.

It doesn’t understand the struggle of people for freedom, for equality, for food. Your money will never care

what happens to you, no matter how much you care what happens to your money.",conspiracy,1529868099,Arantele,18,20,True,2018-06-24

269,Mind. Body. Soul.,"One day at work Mind, Body, and Soul popped in my head and I applied that to the history of us humans being on earth. When we were first put here we didn't know anything about the earth. Just moving rocks around and living. Basically the cavemen. It was this time period where we were in the Body phase of life. After awhile, civilizations like the Egyptians and plenty of others started to realize that's theirs more to life than just building monoliths. There's an afterlife after death and that was when we were in the Soul phase. The Soul phase ended after the Romans (I think that's who it was) saw Jesus Christ walk on water and started preforming these miracles. The Romans saw them and felt that wasn't possible, it wasn't logical for a human being to be able to perform such stunts. So they killed them. If it were the Egyptians they would have worshiped him. After his death is when we moved into being in the era of Mind. Of logic. We have been in this phase of Mind til the year 2012. 2012 was the end of our little 'test'.

276,Why those generally termed as leftist rely so heavily on insults in lieu of argument.,"I'll write this as though I am speaking to one such person, because it will be more impactful to those who are as such if they are able to read it all. 

Why do all of you rely entirely on name calling to support your world-view, and why do you believe that it is a valid form of argument?  

It's simple, really. You are insecure and uncertain of who or what you are in relation to the world. It arises from a lifetime of your actions, and how you are treated, proving to you that you are ""not as good"" or ""inferior"" or ""a loser"". This is why you feel so shaky around those who are truly great at what they do. Of course, you don't consciously realize this, but the great thing about all of our subconsciouses is that they are incapable of lying. So, because you feel that you are lesser, deep deep down, and you, as a social being, want to be useful, you default to believing what you are told by your ""betters"", who you joyfully seek out in all things. 

This is why you say ""I'm doing well"" without really understanding the difference between it and ""I'm doing good"". This is why you have such near-religious reverence for ""experts"", taking even their opinions to be synonymous with truth. This is why snopes saying that a thing is true or untrue is enough for you to believe. The thing you wish for most in the world is to be told you are a good boy; a part of the better-than club; to be more than you believe you are on your own merits. You want this because you cannot objectively enforce this sense of worth by yourself. 

This might sound negative, and it is in a broad sense, but it's far from unique, and those like you have their purpose in society. You helped to reinforce the power of the priest classes, back when they held sway, saying things like ""it is true for it has been written"", and ""we should trust the priests: They can read!"", etc. You are the glue that holds together society while the truly great seek to hold the reins of power, by force of will and belief in their own personal truth, which you so respect. Without those such as yourself, life and society would be a bloody, warring place, moreso than it is already. For instance, during the French revolution, some 85% of people chose to remain impartial; to watch as things unfolded, while 15% of people chose to fight the system in place at the time. I would argue, due to projection that the Pentagon have made of the effects of a civil war, that there are much more ""fighters"" among us in the US then were in France, at the time, due to their models suggesting that a full 30% would rise up in defiance should the call ever be sounded. How much of this is due to fundamental differences between the French and the American spirit, and how much is a result of the comparative severity of abuses, is anyone's guess.

So, as one who does not wish to fight, who are satisfied with being told you are good boys and girls, when you see those who choose to seek their own path, who believe in themselves enough to test the merit of any idea for themselves, and especially if they go against the grain of what is accepted by your revered ""experts"", you again subconsciously think to yourself ""they need correcting! They are being bad boys! What would put me in my place... I know! I hate when I am reminded of my feelings of insecurity and I feel just terrible when people tell me I have bad boy things in me, so, I'll just remind him he's being a bad boy"". You say, in a rough approximation of the style of the experts you default to, ""fallacy!"", without naming the fallacy, or, ""you're mentally ill!"", without naming the illness, or ""you're ignorant!"" without naming what the bad boy is ignoring/lacking, or ""you're a nazi antisemite sexist racist fascist!"", and the like, without really understanding what it is you are critiquing, because to you, emotionally-based shame language is your truth, so objective reality as can be measured takes a backseat. 

I know that you are almost certainly going to be unable to act on this information, because there is some truth to your feelings of inferiority. However, if you've read it, then that purely truthful subconscious place within you has heard, and will begin the work that is too painful for your conscious mind to engage in.

289,[OC] Understanding Psychopathy: The Keystone of Conspiracies,"**Intro**

&gt;“There is no such thing, in the psychopathic universe, as being ‘merely weak’. Whoever is weak is also a sucker; that is, someone who demands to be exploited” - Psychologist Robert Rieber

Lets consider, for a moment, how media likes to portray psychopathy. Frequently in the movies or on TV, a psychopath is shown as someone who doesn’t quite fit in, ‘something’ is off, other characters say. The psychopaths propensity for violence is often tainted with irrationality or ego that leaves behind a paper trail, enough to eventually get caught.

Is this an accurate description?

**Current Understanding**

First, lets examine the work of Dr. Robert D. Hare, an eminent (perhaps THE eminent) researcher on the subject of psychopathy.  

In his book *Without Conscience*, Dr. Hare describes psychopaths as being conscienceless yet rational, not suffering any insanity or debilitation. Instead, they are logical, manipulative, predisposed to criminal acts, selfish and without guilt, shame, remorse or empathy.

To me, this means that psychopathy is an illness, but those afflicted with it are not mentally ill **in the sense which we traditionally imagine.** There is no neurosis that will manifest symptoms others can easily perceive.

Dr. Hare suggests that, often, the psychopath will be aware of their condition from a young age and will learn to effectively conceal their aberrant traits. This is an important piece of the puzzle to keep in the forefront of our attention going forward.

Dr. Hare’s list of psychopathic personality traits include:

* Displaying glibness and superficial charm  
 
* Prone to excessive boredom, in need of constant stimulation  
 
* Acting in a cunning or manipulative way  
 
* Shallow 	emotional response  
 
* Acting out promiscuous sexual behavior  
 
* Avoiding long term relationships  
 
* Feeling a grandiose sense of self worth  
 
* Lying repeatedly without remorse  
 
* Lacking 	remorse or guilt  
 
* Lacking 	empathy for others  
 
* Failing to accept responsibility for ones actions  
 
* Displaying signs of criminal diversity  
 

What do other researchers have to say? Psychological Scientist Erin Buckels, of the University of British Columbia, and her team found some interesting facts while studying sadism. Their research was published in the journal *Psychological Science.*  

&gt;“Some find it hard to reconcile sadism with the concept of ‘normal’ psychological functioning, but our findings show that sadistic tendencies **among otherwise well adjusted people** must be acknowledged… they gain some emotional benefit in causing or simply observing others suffering.”

Emphasis mine because it only indicates that participants did not have a violent criminal record or a self report of deviancy.  

The ultimate implication of this research: There is a portion of the population who possess an intrinsic motivation to inflict suffering on innocent others, even at a personal cost.

How sizeable of a portion of the population are we talking about?  

The above study found sadism traits in \~20&amp;#37; of the test subject. Of course, sadism =/= psychopathy.

Dr. Hare put the number at around 1&amp;#37; of the population. Harvard psychologist Martha Stout claims the number to be around 4&amp;#37;. This gives us a range of \~3-13 million Americans afflicted with the condition.

**Deeper into the Rabbit Hole**

Now, there is one major flaw in the research of Dr. Hare, which he readily admits himself: Almost all of his case studies have come from the prison population.

In other words, mainstream psychology has really only been able to study the **unsuccessful** psychopath. The psychopath who failed to mask their condition from the general public.  

So, what about the millions of **successful** American psychopaths currently walking around with a smile on their face?

Dr. Hare refers to them as “sub-deviant criminals”, those psychopaths who have control over how they manifest their deviance and have the ability to hide it from the general populace. The Doc suggests that, instead of being petty criminals, these psychopaths can be upheld as outstanding members of the community, in fields such as Government, Military, business, medicine, law and law enforcement.

I very much agree with Dr. Hare, though I propose he is only examining the tip of the iceberg of the implications of his research.

Let’s consider a hypothetical case study of a psychopath. Since childhood, they have been acutely aware that they are different from others, whom they consider to be weak and inhibited by morality. As they grow up, they begin to dream of having a position of authority so that they can manipulate, control and abuse others. If they are average or below average intelligence, perhaps they pursue being a cop. But many dream bigger: A politician in Washington, or a 4 star general in the Military, or they ruthlessly rise the corporate ranks, or perhaps they seek out the anonymity of working for an intelligence agency.

See how there is a rational explanation behind the assertion that many revered authority figures in society today are possibly **evil,** gladly lying to us through a smile on their face, concealing the fact that they have a private agenda they are advancing.

There is one more piece of the puzzle, which is the work of Polish psychologist/researcher Andrew Lobaczewski.

Lobaczewski wrote “Political Ponerology” during the height of the USSR and examined how psychopathic arms of the state operated, recruited and brainwashed, among other inquiries…  

We are lucky to have the ability to view his work, as multiple original iterations were burned at the hands of government agents before they made it to a publisher.

A key part of Lobaczewski’s research, which ties everything together, is that ***psychopaths can recognize each other.***  

Yes, a psychopath can recognize the fake facade of a fellow deviant as being similar to their own. What are the implications of this?

From everything examined thus far, we can construct the following thesis:  

**Psychopaths make up between 1-4\% of the population. At a young age, they recognize their deviancy, learn to mask it, develop a disdain for neurotypical humanity, and many are successful. Throughout history, they have formed occulted networks based in their mutual recognition abilities, on their mutual disdain for society, and their mutual desire to manipulate and control this ‘neurotypical other’. Psychopaths seek positions of power, and have over time saturated many governments and power-weilding organizations. In the same was that you and I naturally weed out deviants from our social groups, psychopaths have been weeding out people with ethics an morals from their inner circles. The result is the mutual conditioning of a** ***web of evil*****, where goals and actions become increasingly removed from the institutions original, public intention and towards an agenda of control of the people. This process has been ongoing for centuries in banks, intelligence agencies, militaries, police departments, media, governments and more, in nearly every instance concealing their agenda through a facade of lies and propaganda.**

So, here we have a rational explanation for the existence of a vast conspiracy!

**CONCLUSION**

In the title, I referred to psychopathy as the “keystone”. In architecture, a keystone is a wedge shaped stone at the apex of an arch, locking all the other stones into position.

This is a relevant metaphor on a couple of levels.  

One, it locks in the rationality of examining conspiracies. It provides an excellent answer to the oft-asked questions of “Why would they?” and “How could they keep it a secret?”

Second, it implies that the whole arch, aka the grand conspiracy, can come tumbling down with the removal of a secondary stone. If we label one stone “ignorance of the true nature of psychopathy” and we make this stone disappear, through a collective effort of education of self and other-self, combined with altering our behaviors to stop supporting the psychopathic cabal through our participation in their system, the whole structure will come tumbling down, and the “keystone”, this psychopathic occult elite, will be no more important than any other rock lying in the grass. We’d only need to watch our step.

293,Real world examples / experiments and models that require a non-zero vacuum energy value / zero-point field [x/p /r/holofractal],"#Lamb shift.

&gt;Spontaneous photon emission is an observed effect whereby a light source (an atom) absorbs a quantum of energy and enters an excited state. This occurs through interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field, where the ground state or quantum electrodynamic vacuum mixes with the excited state of the atom. This results in an excitation of the quantized electromagnetic field from its ground state, i.e. a photon is emitted from the vacuum. [As well, such spontaneous photon emissions require vacuum fluctuations for the initial transition in energy states](https://www.crcpress.com/Spontaneous-Emission-and-Laser-Oscillation-in-Microcavities/Yokoyama-Ujihara/p/book/9780849337864).

&gt;It is known that the quantum vacuum is required for this phenomenon to occur, and indeed this is a highly important application in our optical technologies, as it is the basis of fluorescence in lighting sources like neon lights, produced the first televisions, light emitting diodes, and initiates the stimulated emissions that make lasers work.
We will investigate the importance of spontaneous and stimulated photon emission in the biological system later in the course when discussing the cellular holographic information network.

&gt;The Lamb shift is a difference in energy between two electron orbitals of the hydrogen atom, the 2s and 2p orbitals, that was observed but that had not been predicted by theory or the quantum mechanical equations for the hydrogen energy levels. It was soon discovered that the observed difference in energy levels, when theory said they should be the same, was the result of interaction of the electron orbital with the quantum vacuum. Whereby the vacuum fluctuations impart energy to the hydrogen electron causing it to have a higher energy level than predicted a priori.

#Casimir Effect

&gt;In 1948 physicist Hendrik Casimir [predicted](http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf) that two uncharged conductive plates placed a few nanometers apart in a parallel configuration should experience an attractive force due to the suppression of certain modes (wavelengths) of the vacuum fluctuations occurring inside the plate, [resulting in a net force from the surrounding vacuum energy, pushing the plates together](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0302/0302072v2.pdf). Fluctuations of the quantum vacuum have the same effect on atoms, resulting in van der Waals forces. [The Casimir effect was measured and confirmed in 1997 by Steve Lamoreaux of Los Alamos National Laboratory.](http://web.mit.edu/kardar/www/research/seminars/Casimir/PRL-Lamoreaux.pdf)

[Water analogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8Lbq2VYIk)

#Dynamical Casimir Effect

&gt;The dynamical Casimir effect is, as the name suggest, a variation of the Casimir effect in which oscillating mirrors (the uncharged conductive plates) are used instead of static ones. If the mirrors were to oscillate close to the speed of light, then photon pairs of the quantum vacuum would become separated, resulting in photon emission from the vacuum. Technologically, it is not currently possible to achieve such relativistic velocities for oscillating mirrors, but the effect can be stimulated equivalently using modulated superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). In 2011, [Christopher Wilson from Chalmers University in Sweden and his team demonstrated the dynamical Casimir effect](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.4714.pdf).

&gt;The researchers began with an array of 250 superconducting quantum-interference devices, or SQUIDs—circuits that are extraordinarily sensitive to magnetic fields. They inserted the array inside a refrigerator. By carefully exerting magnetic fields on this array, they could vary the speed at which microwave photons traveled through it by a few percent. The researchers then cooled this array to 50 thousandths of a degree Celsius above absolute zero. Because this environment is supercold, it should not emit any radiation, essentially behaving as a vacuum. “We were simply studying these circuits for the purpose of developing an amplifier, which we did,” says researcher Sorin Paraoanu, a theoretical physicist at Aalto University. “But then we asked ourselves—what if there is no signal to amplify? What happens if the vacuum is the signal?”

&gt;The above quote demonstrates how the researchers designing the superconducting quantum-interference devices with extreme sensitivity began to realize that the signals they were trying to amplify and detect may be coming from the vacuum. That is to say, the vacuum has a real and substantive nature that can be empirically demonstrated, and was by way of this realization.

#Sonoluminescence

&gt;Sonoluminescence, or its more frequently studied version known as Single Bubble Sonoluminescence, consisting in the emission of light by a collapsing bubble in water under ultrasounds, represents one of the most challenging and interesting phenomenon in theoretical physics. In fact, despite its relatively easy reproducibility in a simple laboratory, its understanding within the commonly accepted picture of condensed matter remained so far unsatisfactory. On the other hand, the possibility to control the physical process involved in sonoluminescence, representing a sort of nuclear fusion on small scale, could open unthinkable prospects of free energy production from water. Different explanations has been proposed during the past years considering, in various way, the photoemission to be related to electromagnetic Zero Point Field energy dynamics, [by considering the bubble surface as a Casimir force boundary](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ufm..conf..420M). More recently a model invoking Cherenkov radiation emission from superluminal photons generated in quantum vacuum has been successfully proposed.

[Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9B3vzsZsr4)

#Vacuum splitting

&gt;Extremely large electric fields in a small volume raise the vacuum energy potential relative to the surrounding area, resulting in matter/anti-matter pair emission. [NASA has investigated using the Casimir effect for such particle pair creation, to harvest antimatter](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010091016.pdf). The effect has been demonstrated with strong laser pulses, which when interacting with a counter-propagating electron beam will [result in electron-positron emission from the vacuum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0703v2.pdf).

#Zitterbewegung

&gt;Zitterbewegung is a phenomenon where a relativistic fermion, like an electron, is observed to have a “jittering” motion due to its interaction with the vacuum. It was first predicted by Paul Dirac after describing the “Dirac sea” – an analogous description of the quantum vacuum in which the negative energy solutions of quantum mechanics are analyzed in light of the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that all negative energy values for electrons must be occupied. This in effect means that there is an infinite reservoir of negative energy electrons filling all of space. A positive energy electron will interact with this field, and it is observed as an oscillatory, or jittering motion. [This effect was observed in atoms of a Rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/15/7/073011/meta).

#Entanglement Harvesting

&gt;The ground state of a quantum field, such as the electromagnetic field vacuum, contain correlations between different regions of spacetime, which is to say there is nonlocal entanglement of the vacuum. This entanglement can be transferred from the vacuum to particles as a reliable and effective means to produce quantum entanglement for technological applications and for experimental studies [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07180.pdf),[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1090v2.pdf).

&gt;This non-classical behaviour of the vacuum lies deep in the core of quantum theory, and is a key ingredient in phenomena such as, e.g., quantum energy teleportation (with implications, among other areas, in quantum thermodynamics), quantum collect calling (with implications in cosmology), or even in the black hole information loss problem.

&gt;The direct application and utilization of the nonlocal correlations of the vacuum state to produce quantum entangled systems clearly demonstrates that not only does the vacuum have structure and energy, but as well that the vacuum itself is entangled across spatially and temporally distinct spacetime regions.

#Spontaneous parametric down conversion

&gt;Similar to entanglement harvesting, spontaneous parametric down conversion produces quantum entangled photons from the vacuum. This is a widely employed method of quantum entanglement production in technological and experimental applications. This effect is similar to that of spontaneous photon emission and is stimulated by vacuum fluctuations – photons passed through a nonlinear crystal will experience a small degree of spontaneous down-conversion (emission from the vacuum at a lower energy level) with the resulting photon pairs having correlated polarizations, i.e. their polarizations are entangled.

#Effects of vacuum crystal-lattice structure on polarized light

&gt;Early in the investigation of the nature of the quantum vacuum it was proposed that crystal-lattice structure of the vacuum should make it behave as a birefringent medium (like tetrahedrally-oriented crystals), such that different polarizations of light will be separated. In a recent analysis, just such an effect was observed as recent astronomical observations show that the intense magnetic field from a neutron star has caused light to become polarized as it passes through the strongly magnetized vacuum around it. This is an effect that would not be observed if space were empty, instead it indicates that [the vacuum is comprised of polarizable quantum harmonic oscillations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08323.pdf).",conspiracy,1529929398,AcceptableSkin,22,55,True,2018-06-25

The unspoken part of the narrative is that downtown attracts a lot of African American youth and a certain amount of unruly behavior, harassment, etc.  My take is that this is more true than not true, and I've found the sketchy quality to downtown at night worse than any experience I've ever had in New York City.

I'm pretty certain the entire purpose of the pot stings hasn't been about pot, but a convenient leverage point for the cops to go after ""hooligans"".  While it certainly seems to line up with the idea that the war on drugs is a war on minorities, the op-ed piece by the ex-cop mentioned *another* ex-cop's op-ed (former chief, too, IIRC) who said we could fix this by just legalizing marijuana.

Where my dim bulb lit up, though, was where he asked ""That proposal raises the question of what will become of the individuals who have been selling on those corners?""

It made me wonder -- what if drug criminalization wasn't motivated by *oppression* of minorities, but more as a means of predictable economic containment, and especially for marijuana?  If you legalized marijuana, suddenly you have undermined some meaningful economic activity from minority communities and the cops fear you're opening the door to chaos by redirecting a bunch of people involved in low-level pot trade into other criminal activities.  The cops know pot isn't dangerous and would rather have the underclass involved in that than in other criminal activity.  The subtext is of course racist in a way, as it assumes poor blacks are solely criminally motivated and aren't dealing pot because of no other economic choices, although the counterpoint to this is that because they have few other economic opportunities they'll likely just switch to whatever the next most easy/lucrative criminal option is.

I'm sure this isn't a groundbreaking inspiration (sorry in advance).  And I doubt its been borne out in states that have legalized it, but flawed though this may be as a ""cop theory"" it may still be a motivating theory by cops.

315,The NSA’s Hidden Spy Hubs In Eight U.S. Cities,"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/25/att-internet-nsa-spy-hubs/

THE SECRETS ARE hidden behind fortified walls in cities across the United States, inside towering windowless skyscrapers and fortress-like concrete structures that were built to withstand earthquakes and even nuclear attack. Thousands of people pass by the buildings each day and rarely give them a second glance, because their function is not publicly known. They are an integral part of one of the world’s largest telecommunications networks – and they are also linked to a controversial National Security Agency surveillance program.

Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. In each of these cities, The Intercept has identified an AT&amp;T facility containing networking equipment that transports large quantities of internet traffic across the United States and the world. A body of evidence – including classified NSA documents, public records, and interviews with several former AT&amp;T employees – indicates that the buildings are central to an NSA spying initiative that has for years monitored billions of emails, phone calls, and online chats passing across U.S. territory.

The NSA considers AT&amp;T to be one of its most trusted partners and has lauded the company’s “extreme willingness to help.” It is a collaboration that dates back decades. Little known, however, is that its scope is not restricted to AT&amp;T’s customers. According to the NSA’s documents, it values AT&amp;T not only because it “has access to information that transits the nation,” but also because it maintains unique relationships with other phone and internet providers. The NSA exploits these relationships for surveillance purposes, commandeering AT&amp;T’s massive infrastructure and using it as a platform to covertly tap into communications processed by other companies.

Much has previously been reported about the NSA’s surveillance programs. But few details have been disclosed about the physical infrastructure that enables the spying. Last year, The Intercept highlighted a likely NSA facility in New York City’s Lower Manhattan. Now, we are revealing for the first time a series of other buildings across the U.S. that appear to serve a similar function, as critical parts of one of the world’s most powerful electronic eavesdropping systems, hidden in plain sight.

“It’s eye-opening and ominous the extent to which this is happening right here on American soil,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “It puts a face on surveillance that we could never think of before in terms of actual buildings and actual facilities in our own cities, in our own backyards.”

There are hundreds of AT&amp;T-owned properties scattered across the U.S. The eight identified by The Intercept serve a specific function, processing AT&amp;T customers’ data and also carrying large quantities of data from other internet providers. They are known as “backbone” and “peering” facilities.

While network operators would usually prefer to send data through their own networks, often a more direct and cost-efficient path is provided by other providers’ infrastructure. If one network in a specific area of the country is overloaded with data traffic, another operator with capacity to spare can sell or exchange bandwidth, reducing the strain on the congested region. This exchange of traffic is called “peering” and is an essential feature of the internet.

Because of AT&amp;T’s position as one of the U.S.’s leading telecommunications companies, it has a large network that is frequently used by other providers to transport their customers’ data. Companies that “peer” with AT&amp;T include the American telecommunications giants Sprint, Cogent Communications, and Level 3, as well as foreign companies such as Sweden’s Telia, India’s Tata Communications, Italy’s Telecom Italia, and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom.

AT&amp;T currently boasts 19,500 “points of presence” in 149 countries where internet traffic is exchanged. But only eight of the company’s facilities in the U.S. offer direct access to its “common backbone” – key data routes that carry vast amounts of emails, internet chats, social media updates, and internet browsing sessions. These eight locations are among the most important in AT&amp;T’s global network. They are also highly valued by the NSA, documents indicate.

The data exchange between AT&amp;T and other networks initially takes place outside AT&amp;T’s control, sources said, at third-party data centers that are owned and operated by companies such as California’s Equinix. But the data is then routed – in whole or in part – through the eight AT&amp;T buildings, where the NSA taps into it. By monitoring what it calls the “peering circuits” at the eight sites, the spy agency can collect “not only AT&amp;T’s data, they get all the data that’s interchanged between AT&amp;T’s network and other companies,” according to Mark Klein, a former AT&amp;T technician who worked with the company for 22 years. It is an efficient point to conduct internet surveillance, Klein said, “because the peering links, by the nature of the connections, are liable to carry everybody’s traffic at one point or another during the day, or the week, or the year.”

Christopher Augustine, a spokesperson for the NSA, said in a statement that the agency could “neither confirm nor deny its role in alleged classified intelligence activities.” Augustine declined to answer questions about the AT&amp;T facilities, but said that the NSA “conducts its foreign signals intelligence mission under the legal authorities established by Congress and is bound by both policy and law to protect U.S. persons’ privacy and civil liberties.”

Jim Greer, an AT&amp;T spokesperson, said that AT&amp;T was “required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests, and other legal requirements.” He added that the company provides “voluntary assistance to law enforcement when a person’s life is in danger and in other immediate, emergency situations. In all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law.”

Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent Communications, told The Intercept that he had no knowledge of the surveillance at the eight AT&amp;T buildings, but said he believed “the core premise that the NSA or some other agency would like to look at traffic … at an AT&amp;T facility.” He said he suspected that the surveillance is likely carried out on “a limited basis,” due to technical and cost constraints. If the NSA were trying to “ubiquitously monitor” data passing across AT&amp;T’s networks, Schaeffer added, he would be “extremely concerned.”

Sprint, Telia, Tata Communications, Telecom Italia, and Deutsche Telekom did not respond to requests for comment. CenturyLink, which owns Level 3, said it would not discuss “matters of national security.”

THE EIGHT LOCATIONS are featured on a top-secret NSA map, which depicts U.S. facilities that the agency relies upon for one of its largest surveillance programs, code-named FAIRVIEW. AT&amp;T is the only company involved in FAIRVIEW, which was first established in 1985, according to NSA documents, and involves tapping into international telecommunications cables, routers, and switches.

In 2003, the NSA launched new internet mass surveillance methods, which were pioneered under the FAIRVIEW program. The methods were used by the agency to collect – within a few months – some 400 billion records about people’s internet communications and activity, the New York Times previously reported. FAIRVIEW was also forwarding more than 1 million emails every day to a “keyword selection system” at the NSA’s Fort Meade headquarters.

Central to the internet spying are eight “peering link router complex” sites, which are pinpointed on the top-secret NSA map. The locations of the sites mirror maps of AT&amp;T’s networks, obtained by The Intercept from public records, which show “backbone node with peering” facilities in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

One of the AT&amp;T maps contains unique codes individually identifying the addresses of the facilities in each of the cities.

Among the pinpointed buildings, there is a nuclear blast-resistant, windowless facility in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood; in Washington, D.C., a fortress-like, concrete structure less than half a mile south of the U.S. Capitol; in Chicago, an earthquake-resistant skyscraper in the West Loop Gate area; in Atlanta, a 429-foot art deco structure in the heart of the city’s downtown district; and in Dallas, a cube-like building with narrow windows and large vents on its exterior, located in the Old East district.

Elsewhere, on the west coast of the U.S., there are three more facilities: in downtown Los Angeles, a striking concrete tower near the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Staples Center, two blocks from the most important internet exchange in the region; in Seattle, a 15-story building with blacked-out windows and reinforced concrete foundations, near the city’s waterfront; and in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood, a building where it was previously claimed that the NSA was monitoring internet traffic from a secure room on the sixth floor.

The peering sites – otherwise known in AT&amp;T parlance as “Service Node Routing Complexes,” or SNRCs – were developed following the internet boom in the mid- to late 1990s. By March 2009, the NSA’s documents say it was tapping into “peering circuits at the eight SNRCs.”

The facilities’ purpose was to bolster AT&amp;T’s network, improving its reliability and enabling future growth. They were developed under the leadership of an Iranian-American innovator and engineer named Hossein Eslambolchi, who was formerly AT&amp;T’s chief technology officer and president of AT&amp;T Labs, a division of the company that focuses on research and development.

Eslambolchi told The Intercept that the project to set up the facilities began after AT&amp;T asked him to help create “the largest internet protocol network in the world.” He obliged and began implementing his network design by placing large Cisco routers inside former AT&amp;T phone switching facilities across the U.S. When planning the project, he said he divided AT&amp;T’s network into different regions, “and in every quadrant I will have what I will call an SNRC.”

 During his employment with AT&amp;T, Eslambolchi said he had to take a polygraph test, and he obtained a government security clearance. “I was involved in very, very top, heavy-duty projects for a few of these three-letter agencies,” he said, in an apparent reference to U.S. intelligence agencies. “They all loved me.”

He would not confirm or deny the exact locations of the eight peering sites identified by The Intercept or discuss the classified work he carried out while with the company. “You put a gun to my head,” he said, “I’m not going to tell you.”

Other former AT&amp;T employees, however, were more forthcoming.

A former senior member of AT&amp;T’s technical staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, confirmed with “100 percent” certainty the locations of six of the eight peering facilities identified by The Intercept. The source, citing direct knowledge of the facilities and their function, verified the addresses of the buildings in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

A second former AT&amp;T employee confirmed the locations of the remaining two sites, in Chicago and San Francisco. “I worked with all of them,” said Philip Long, who was employed by AT&amp;T for more than two decades as a technician servicing its networks. Long’s work with AT&amp;T was carried out mostly in California, but he said his job required him to be in contact with the company’s other facilities across the U.S. In about 2005, Long recalled, he received orders to move “every internet backbone circuit I had in northern California” through the San Francisco AT&amp;T building identified by The Intercept as one of the eight NSA spy hubs. Long said that, at the time, he felt suspicious of the changes, because they were unusual and unnecessary. “We thought we were routing our circuits so that they could grab all the data,” he said. “We thought it was the government listening.” He retired from his job with AT&amp;T in 2014.

A third former AT&amp;T employee reviewed The Intercept’s research and said he believed it accurately identified all eight of the facilities. “The site data certainly seems correct,” said Thomas Saunders, who worked as a data networking consultant for AT&amp;T in New York City between 1995 and 2004. “Those nodes aren’t going to move.”

AN ESTIMATED 99 PERCENT of the world’s intercontinental internet traffic is transported through hundreds of giant fiber optic cables hidden beneath the world’s oceans. A large portion of the data and communications that pass across the cables is routed at one point through the U.S., partly because of the country’s location – situated between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia – and partly because of the pre-eminence of American internet companies, which provide services to people globally.

The NSA calls this predicament “home field advantage” – a kind of geographic good fortune. “A target’s phone call, email, or chat will take the cheapest path, not the physically most direct path,” one agency document explains. “Your target’s communications could easily be flowing into and through the U.S.”

Once the internet traffic arrives on U.S. soil, it is processed by American companies. And that is why, for the NSA, AT&amp;T is so indispensable. The company claims it has one of the world’s most powerful networks, the largest of its kind in the U.S. AT&amp;T routinely handles masses of emails, phone calls, and internet chats. As of March 2018, some 197 petabytes of data – the equivalent of more than 49 trillion pages of text, or 60 billion average-sized mp3 files – traveled across its networks every business day.

The NSA documents, which come from the trove provided to The Intercept by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, describe AT&amp;T as having been “aggressively involved” in aiding the agency’s surveillance programs. One example of this appears to have taken place at the eight facilities under a classified initiative called SAGUARO.

As part of SAGUARO, AT&amp;T developed a strategy to help the NSA electronically eavesdrop on internet data from the “peering circuits” at the eight sites, which were said to connect to the “common backbone,” major data routes carrying internet traffic.

The company worked with the NSA to rank communications flowing through its networks on the basis of intelligence value, prioritizing data depending on which country it was derived from, according to a top-secret agency document.

NSA diagrams reveal that after it collects data from AT&amp;T’s “access links” and “peering partners,” it is sent to a “centralized processing facility” code-named PINECONE, located somewhere in New Jersey. Inside the PINECONE facility, there is a secure space in which there is both NSA-controlled and AT&amp;T-controlled equipment. Internet traffic passes through an AT&amp;T “distribution box” to two NSA systems. From there, the data is then transferred about 200 miles southwest to its final destination: NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland.

At the Maryland compound, the communications collected from AT&amp;T’s networks are integrated into powerful systems called MAINWAY and MARINA, which the NSA uses to analyze metadata – such as the “to” and “from” parts of emails, and the times and dates they were sent. The communications obtained from AT&amp;T are also made accessible through a tool named XKEYSCORE, which NSA employees use to search through the full contents of emails, instant messenger chats, web-browsing histories, webcam photos, information about downloads from online services, and Skype sessions.

THE NSA’S PRIMARY mission is to gather foreign intelligence. The agency has broad legal powers to monitor emails, phone calls, and other forms of correspondence as they are being transported across the U.S., and it can compel companies such as AT&amp;T to install surveillance equipment within their networks.

Under a Ronald Reagan-era presidential directive – Executive Order 12333 – the NSA has what it calls “transit authority,” which it says enables it to eavesdrop on “communications which originate and terminate in foreign countries, but traverse U.S. territory.” That could include, for example, an email sent by a person in France to a person in Mexico, which on its way to its destination was routed through a server in California. According to the NSA’s documents, it was using AT&amp;T’s networks as of March 2013 to gather some 60 million foreign-to-foreign emails every day, 1.8 billion per month.

Without an individualized court order, it is illegal for the NSA to spy on communications that are wholly domestic, such as emails sent back and forth between two Americans living in Texas. However, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the agency began eavesdropping on Americans’ international calls and emails that were passing between the U.S. and other countries. That practice was exposed by the New York Times in 2005 and triggered what became known as the “warrantless wiretapping” scandal.

Critics argued that the surveillance of Americans’ international communications was illegal, because the NSA had carried it out without obtaining warrants from a judge and had instead acted on the orders of President George W. Bush. In 2008, Congress weighed into the dispute and controversially authorized elements of the warrantless wiretapping program by enacting Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, or FISA. The new law allowed the NSA to continue sweeping up Americans’ international communications without a warrant, so long as it did so “incidentally” while it was targeting foreigners overseas – for instance, if it was monitoring people in Pakistan, and they were talking with Americans in the U.S. by phone, email, or through an internet chat service.

Within AT&amp;T’s networks, there is filtering equipment designed to separate foreign and domestic internet data before it is passed to the NSA, the agency’s documents show. Filtering technology is often used by internet providers for security reasons, enabling them to keep tabs on problems with their networks, block out spam, or monitor hacking attacks. But the same tools can be used for government surveillance.

“You can essentially trick the routers into redirecting a small subset of traffic you really care about, which you can monitor in more detail,” said Jennifer Rexford, a computer scientist who worked for AT&amp;T Labs between 1996 and 2005.

According to the NSA’s documents, it programs its surveillance systems to focus on particular IP addresses – a set of numbers that identify a computer – associated with foreign countries. A classified 2012 memo describes the agency’s efforts to use IP addresses to home in on internet data passing between the U.S. and particular “regions of interest,” including Iran, Afghanistan, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan, Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. But this process is not an exact science, as people can use privacy or anonymity tools to change or spoof their IP addresses. A person in Israel could use privacy software to masquerade as if they were accessing the internet in the U.S. Likewise, an internet user in the U.S. could make it appear as if they were online in Israel. It is unclear how effective the NSA’s systems are at detecting such anomalies.

In October 2011, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approves the surveillance operations carried out under Section 702 of FISA, found that there were “technological limitations” with the agency’s internet eavesdropping equipment. It was “generally incapable of distinguishing” between some kinds of data, the court stated. As a consequence, Judge John D. Bates ruled, the NSA had been intercepting the communications of “non-target United States persons and persons in the United States,” violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling, which was declassified in August 2013, concluded that the agency had acquired some 13 million “internet transactions” during one six-month period, and had unlawfully gathered “tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications” each year.

The root of the issue was that the NSA’s technology was not only targeting communications sent to and from specific surveillance targets. Instead, the agency was sweeping up people’s emails if they had merely mentioned particular information about surveillance targets.

A top-secret NSA memo about the court’s ruling, which has not been disclosed before, explained that the agency was collecting people’s messages en masse if a single one were found to contain a “selector” – like an email address or phone number – that featured on a target list.

“One example of this is when a user of a webmail service accesses her inbox; if the inbox contains one email message that contains an NSA tasked selector, NSA will acquire a copy of the entire inbox, not just the individual email message that contains the tasked selector,” the memo stated.

The court’s ruling left the agency with two options: shut down the spying based on mentions of targets completely, or ensure that protections were put in place to stop the unlawfully collected communications from being reviewed. The NSA chose the latter option, and created a “cautionary banner” that warned its analysts not to read particular messages unless they could confirm that they had been lawfully obtained.

But the cautionary banner did not solve the problem. The NSA’s analysts continued to access the same data repositories to search, unlawfully, for information on Americans. In April 2017, the agency publicly acknowledged these violations, which it described as “inadvertent compliance incidents.” It said that it would no longer use surveillance programs authorized under Section 702 of FISA to harvest messages that mentioned its targets, citing “technological constraints, United States person privacy interests, and certain difficulties in implementation.”

The messages that the NSA had unlawfully collected were swept up using a method of surveillance known as “upstream,” which the agency still deploys for other surveillance programs authorized under both Section 702 of FISA and Executive Order 12333. The upstream method involves tapping into communications as they are passing across internet networks – precisely the kind of electronic eavesdropping that appears to have taken place at the eight locations identified by The Intercept.",conspiracy,1529938741,ShellOilNigeria,15,122,True,2018-06-25

324,"Western doctors, in general, know nothing about nutrition. This is intentional, as their whole purpose was to sell drugs manufactured by the Rockefeller Chemical Empire","Western doctors,  in general,  know nothing about nutrition.   They're  taught nothing about the healing powers of food in medical school because their whole purpose (by dedign) is to prescribe pharmaceuticals for the Rockefeller Medicine machine.   

I had to go to the hospital once (emergency medicine is the best and most justifiable aspect of Western medicine) and while I was there started to develop a huge cold sore on my lip from high fever.  

The herpes virus in cold sores can be deactivated with lysine; iirc it interferes with an enzyme the virus needs for replication. Every time I feel a cold sore coming on,  I take lysine orally and apply an ointment containing lysine.   The sores never develop because I halt the virus in it's tracks and it goes back into dormancy. 

I tried to explain this to my nurses and doctor,  a cardiovascular surgeon.  I didn't have any lysine at the hospital and could tell the outbreak was going to be insane if I didn't get some in me, so I requested it and offered my explanation as to why I needed it. 

The intereference of lysine with the function of herpes virus is an established scientific fact,  yet none of the nurses nor my doctor believed me.  I could overhear them discussing my ""odd beliefs"" in the hallway. They finally decided,  ""well, it's just a supplement, it isn't going to hurt him"", and they agreed to let me have the lysine as some sort of placebo (from their perspective) to help me feel better. 

**People can go to medical school for decades, but,  if the schools are limiting the information distributed to only that which benefits particular agendas, the students are only being taught how to further that agenda**. We end up with medical experts that know very little about how the body actually works outside the context how Rockefeller pharmaceuticals affect it. 

I started writing this in a comment concerning cancer treatments.  

People, generally,  ""get"" cancer because their immune system becomes so compromised that their body no longer kills off cancerous cells before they become a problem.

The Western medical cartel will never admit to this, but will instead advocate their brand new ""Immune response stimulating cancer treatments"" which cost an arm and a leg and tend to only extend the patient's life for a few more months while the draining of their savings account occurs.

They've already been pushing this type of bullshit ""treatment"" for over a year on the ""ask your doctor"" ads. Funny thing is, the shit they're shooting people up with and charging big money for just doesn't stimulate your immune system as efficiently and properly as clean foods you can pick up from your local farmers market or grow yourself.

Pharmaceuticals do not heal you. ""Tricking"" your body into an immune response with drugs or adjuvants is damaging to your entire immune system.  It isn't supposed to be cattle-prodded that way. 

If you want to heal your body,  nutrition is the key.  You are what you eat; don't build the foundation for your immune system with processed ""food"".

352,If you want to help fight the system do this,"Bring a bunch of public attention to these [microwave transponders](https://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/02/t_PR-P1-Cell-tower-close.jpg) which they purport to be cell towers but are actually not. This microwave transponders are not always hoisted together like in the picture, they are sometimes drilled individually onto tall buildings. These are not cell towers because cell towers don’t even exist! Yes there are antennas but those are located at actual telecommunication buildings. When you complain to your cell provider that you have no service in whatever area all they do is setup a repeater which is just one tiny antenna not this scary looking boxes. To prove my point next time you see [these](https://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/02/t_PR-P1-Cell-tower-close.jpg) beam boxes, check your cell service. I promise you it will be the same regardless of how close you are to it. It’s not a cell tower it’s a microwave emitter. 

How can you help? Bring attention to them, stand by them, take obvious video clips, engage people nearby and inform them that these things are not cell towers but part of a weaponized system against citizens. Now to be clear, I’m not promoting vandalism but I’m sure morally you would be in the clear as these things are weapons and you would merely be defending yourself. When you engage people make sure to tell the people to check their cell service by things to see for themselves that they are not cell towers. Also show them a picture of this [repeater](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1855/6777/products/JEFA-XR-PLUS-01_large.jpg?v=1518727632) reminding them that this is how cell service antennas look like. Show them that these microwave boxes are always discussed at town hall meetings by concerned citizens yet they are never given a straight answer as to their exact nature. Bring as much attention as you can to these things, subconsciously people are already aware that they look dangerous as fuck so all it takes is some simple convincing.

360,"The ""Alex Jones is Bill Hicks"" meme was created years ago as disinformation to delegitimize any criticism of AJ, and tarnish Bill Hicks reputation within the conspiracy community. Every time somebody shares a great clip of Hicks, somebody immediately deflects to ""He's actually Alex jones!!1""","Hicks' comedy was not only critical of the ruling class and the elite power structure, but his message was also one of unity and promoting peace. Today, his work is online for all to see, and standup comedians are traditionally targeted by TPTB. Their unique blend of philosophy, criticism of the ruling class, and disarming comedy is very effective at reaching and enlightening the masses. 

Therefore, I think the disinformation agents came up with a way to tie him to Alex Jones, somebody who seems to be universally hated by the people on this sub, rightfully so. In my opinion it's just a clever way to deflect from any good Bill Hicks content and start a big argument that deflects from the actual content. Thus, the ""Bill Hicks is Alex Jones!"" meme was born.

Hicks was laid back, an advocate for peace and the protection of our civil liberties. He advocated the use of psychedelic drugs as a means of self exploration and therapy, and divorced himself from partisan politics. Jones is a hyperactive right wing extremist who supports the current establishment. Their mannerisms and appearances alone are so vastly different, it's not even remotely close.

370,(1026). Hot Housing market (6/24/2018),"(1026). Hot Housing market (6/24/2018)

I am innocent. To eliminate an innocent man by framing him in criminal case takes a lot of money. The Feds(FBI and DEA) used to get the money from real estate business. 

[img] http://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-San-Francisco-California-median-home-sales-prices-1971-2015-05.png [/img]

The index curve of the median house price of San Francisco represents the course of the persecution of the Feds. The tactic is to refinance the house for more money if the house price keeps going up. e.g. When they bought a house of 300k in 1990
They paid 10% down payment,that's 30k. Then in 2007 when the house price went up to 680k, they could get 380k cash by refinancing. Now it's 1.61 million, they could get another 930k from it. 30k for 1.31 million, what a profit. Any time when the case is over, they leave the debt for bank to take care. The point is to keep the housing market hot while the case is alive. 


In the meantime, the housing babble has exploded in 2007. The Feds(FBI and DEA) saved it from collapse by Q.E. done by Federal Reserve. See reference (#945)
To keep the balloon from popping off, they keep the interest as low as possible. Now the media house price of St. Francisco is 1.61 million. That's where my sisters live. San Jose's is higher, that's where I live.

Regrettably, I couldn't catch any screenshots because it took me a second to process, and I haven't been able to find a viewable version elsewhere.

The ad depicts Jim with the supposed director of the film being shown, as they watch it in the crowd.  The director is messing with his laptop and Jim says something along the lines of how ""with X new technology you can change the ending to something people actually like."" And so, he runs to the back, edits the movie and on screen we see a couple kissing, narration saying ""the bad is behind us now"" and behind the couple is a meteor crashing into earth, to which the audience""oo""s and ""ah""s at.

While obviously they could use any natural disasters and meters are pretty easy to visualize, if anyone remembers, during the time of the Hawaii false alarm missile incident there were both an influx in ads depicting meteor apocalypse and an actual scare that maybe meteors could come.  When I look back now, there were wild predictions and dates and truly I can remember a sense of panic within the community.  That being said, this video, if seen conspiratorially connected, almost seems as an admission or a gloating of the manipulation of the media.

This meteor metaphor is literally the idea of false reality/images invading our perceived realities.  The meteor was added to the film as spectacle since normal romance doesn't cut it anymore, which caused an emotional reaction in the spectators.  It's as though reality and our just as real non-reality are blending and the ones who can control everything are understanding the ropes and the power tied to the ropes.

381,What Do These 2 Very Obvious Signs Say to You About What's Happening Right Now?," Here we have two very distinct and very obvious signs from the Universe about Donald Trump and what he is and what he's come to do. 

 [http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284) 

The first sign involves 3 books. 2 are children's books that follow a boy named Baron Trump (Donald Trump had a fake name he use to use for press named John Baron or John Barron. His last child is also named Barron Trump). Baron Trump is very wealthy and lives in Castle Trump. He becomes bored with his luxurious lifestyle and ends up in Russia on an adventure that shapes the rest of his life. He is guided by a ""master of all masters"" named Don. He's on a quest to find a ""world within a world"" and the way to find it is told to him in a phrase that he keeps repeating to himself ""The people will tell thee"" He is repeatedly called ""the little Baron"". He has a such a great brain that he'll get so focused on things, he won't notice his entire house is up flames before it's cool. He's quick to anger and show his poiwer. He claims no Trump had ever surrendered and he never would either!

The last book of the 3 is called ""The Last President"" From the article:

&gt;The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a ""state of uproar"" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,"" police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. ""Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,"" the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. ""Would the troops be in time to save it?  
&gt;  
&gt;The Last President doesn’t follow the same fictional narrative of Lockwood’s previous novels, though the links to Trump are once again abundantly clear. The president’s hometown of New York City is fearing the collapse of the republic in this book, also titled 1900, immediately following the transition of presidential power. Some Americans begin forming a resistance, protesting what was seen as a corrupt and unethical election process.  


Strangely, he is an outsider candidate said to represent the “common man,” amid claims he will liberate the people from the bankers - an anti-establishment candidate as Mr Trump was billed as being. 

 [https://411mania.com/movies/the-trump-era-films-trackdown-the-end-of-the-world/](https://411mania.com/movies/the-trump-era-films-trackdown-the-end-of-the-world/) 

The name of this specific episode is called THE END OF THE WORLD.

&gt; There was a fifties Western television series (Trackdown) that had an episode called, “The End of the World.” In this episode, the series’ main character, Hoby Gilman (played by Robert Culp), visits a town that has been left shook.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Why has this town been left in such a state of despair? The end of the world is coming of course.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Why does this town believe this? A man actually named Walter Trump (played by Lawrence Dobkin) rose up out of nowhere and claimed that the world was going to end and that only HE had the power stop it.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The people immediately fall in line and believe every word that he said. The outsider, Hoby, is the only one to call Trump out on his lies. How does Trump respond when Hoby calls him out?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump actually threatens to sue him.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The cops of course rally behind Trump. One of them (who is proven to be in on the scheme) asks Hoby rhetorically, “Can you prove he’s wrong?” He then says to Hoby, “It’s a lot safer to go his way than yours.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby tries his luck with the local judge who meekly stands by and says there is nothing that can be done. He warns Hoby, “Anyone who tries to change their minds might get hurt. They’re not going to believe you.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The judge uses an apt metaphor though to at least shed some light on the situation.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""Can you prove that's what he really has in mind?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""It's obvious.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""But can you prove it?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""What if I take him?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""On what charge?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""Fraud""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""Don't you see, he's not exactly guilty of fraud.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""I live here, I know these people pretty well. And right now, there's nothing in the world that can change their minds. And anyone who tries to is gonna end up getting hurt. They're not gonna listen.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""Well what if he starts a panic, it could happen.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""Sure, you might as well try to spit out a forest fire.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""There's got to be some way to stop him.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""If there is, I don't know it. It's a funny thing. When we were kids, we were all afraid of the dark. And we grew up, and we weren't afraid anymore but it's funny how a big lie can make us all kids again.""   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The story does not stop getting weirder from there. Walter Trump actually calls his device (which is simply a parasol) a “Wall” that will protect everyone from the outside danger.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As soon as Trump gets a bit of power, he punished people monetarily for there being a single vocal doubter (Hoby). That frightened people into mob violence. Hoby is attacked for providing any resistance.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;When Hoby finally corners Trump, it’s revealed that our snake-oil salesman’s instincts are to buy people off. The idea clearly conveyed is that most people have been content to just sit back and take his payment in exchange for keeping quiet.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby continued to resist though and recognized that proving one lie was not enough. Everything had to be a lie for people to stop believing Trump.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s not much in the way of analysis required here. There’s not much in the way of practical advice for people looking to resist Trump. Watching and breaking down this artifact was more just about appreciating the absolute bizarre coincidences. Enjoy? 

Some more relevant quotes from the episode:

&gt;Walter Trump: ""A message I ALONE was able to read in the fires of the universe."" (25 secs)  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Donald Trump: ""I alone can fix it!"" [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGenVcak5nI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGenVcak5nI)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Random: ""What are you selling Mr, SNAKE oil?"" (57 secs)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrator: The people were ready to believe. Like sheep they ran to the slaughterhouse. And waiting for them was the High Priest of Fraud.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Walter Trump: ""I am the only one. Trust me. I can build a wall around your homes that nothing will penetrate.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Townperson: ""What do we do? How can we save ourselves?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Walter Trump: ""You ask how do you BUILD THAT WALL."" (9:46)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""You're a liar Trump."" (11:02)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Walter Trump then starts pointing to the sky and saying ""Look there it is!"" Then other people start saying they see things too when they really don't. They become under Trump's delusion.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""You're seeing what you want to see. There's nothing up there!""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Then Walter Trump, who the narrator calls the High Priest of Fraud, seems to make fire come down from the sky.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Revelations 13:13  
And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That beast is also known as the False Prophet  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Someone threatens to kill the one guy telling them the truth while Trump takes all their money.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Judge: ""Trump is sure having his way. When the town doesn't burn down, who's gonna get the credit?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The one part that totally doesn't jive is they say that Trump doesn't want the credit, he just wants the money. Donald Trump would definitely want both, probably the credit evermore so.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby: ""You're under arrest Trump.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""What charge?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""You write it any way you like. Grand theft, fraud, I think a jury will find it stealing.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""How do you expect to prove it?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Cue Trump trying to bribe him\*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sheriff is revealed to be in on it with Trump and accuses him of trying to split with the money.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Walter Trump: ""You don't think I'd lie do you?""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sheriff: ""You don't want an answer to that.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;He then kills Trump because he doesn't want to get exposed due to Trump's arrest and Trump flipping on him.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Hoby then brings the Sheriff in front of the town to tell them the truth.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrator: ""They wanted to believe him, but they still weren't over the hump. He had to find one crack in their fear. Until the crowd knew that everything Trump said was a lie, there was no hope for him. The con man would always get the credit for saving the town. As long as the parasols (The Wall) were up, Trump was still believed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;One last odd thing, the first name that pops up during the credits at the end, the first name of the director: Donald 

Walter Trump in the TV show also makes reference to technology he has the deflect meteorites from space. With the announcement of the space force from Donald Trump, the prevailing idea is that it will be used to keep asteroids away from Earth.

So with all of this laid out, what are these very specific signs telling us? In my opinion, it's telling is that Trump is the Antichrist. That doesn't mean the Bible is 100&amp;#37; true or that things will happen exactly how it says it will happen in the Bible, just that we know the nature of which Trump is and it's not good.

Referring to Trump as ""the little Barron"" can only mean one thing in my mind. Trump is the little horn from the Book of Daniel. The last king who is not like the others, speaks boastfully and goes to war with the world. The last king of the last kingdom that is made of iron with clay mixed at the feet because it is divided and it has a mixture of people.

&gt;**Daniel 2**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**31** “Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. **32** The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, **33** its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. **34** While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. **35** Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;**36** “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. **37** Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; **38** in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;**39** “After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. **40** Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. **41** Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. **42** As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. **43** And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.  
&gt;  
&gt;**44** “In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. **45** This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.

So that last kingdom sounds a lot like America doesn't it?

&gt;**Daniel 7**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrotedown the substance of his dream.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2** Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. **3** Four great beasts,each different from the others, came up out of the sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4** “The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5** “And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’  
&gt;  
&gt;**6** “After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.  
&gt;  
&gt;**7** “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.  
&gt;  
&gt;**8** “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.  
&gt;  
&gt; **11** “Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 

&gt;“So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: **17** ‘The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. **18** But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’  
&gt;  
&gt;**19** “Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. **20** I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. **21** As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, **22** until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.  
&gt;  
&gt;**23** “He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.**24** The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. **25** He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.

The little horn is the last king of the last kingdom. The Last President. Ram horns were turned into trumpets in those days, Trump-Pence. 

The Bible even explains why so many people are completely delusional in their support for Trump, especially Christians.

&gt;**2 Thessalonians 2**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Man of Lawlessness**  
&gt;  
&gt;**2** Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, **2** not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. **3** Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+2&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29665a)\] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. **4** He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5** Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? **6** And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. **7** For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. **8** And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. **9** The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,**10** and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.**11** For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie **12** and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.

Just want to reiterate this specific verse to make the point.

&gt;**They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.**

Now, where is all of this going? The Bible says he will try to make us all take a mark so that we cannot buy or sell with out it. It will be a number of a man. Well each of us has our own number assigned to us at birth, our Social Security Number. With the recent Equifax hack, Trump's White House has concluded that SSN is out of date and we need to figure out new technology. The prevailing idea so far has been using blockchain, the same tech used for Bitcoin.

&gt; DNAtix has completed the first Proof Of Concept (POC) test by transferring the complete genome sequence of a virus over the Ethereum Blockchain. This test is a key milestone and the company believes that it is the first time that anyone has successfully transferred a DNA sequence over a blockchain. 

Now, they say they are doing this for the purpose of sharing genetic information anonymously and maybe they are. But all technology that starts out for good purposes will get subverted for evil if it can be. Imagine from the time you are born, you are genetically tied to a governmental financial system for life. It's the enslavement of the entire human population sourced into our very own DNA.

Now how is Trump or anyone going to convince people to do this? Well it's been pretty obvious the economy we're in right now is about to burst in the next few years at the most. The global financial collapse will be the catalyst to it but something else will happen to. Trump's Space Force isn't just some dumb idea he has. Someone is in his ear, just like with Reagan. 25 scientists mysteriously died working on Reagan's ""Star Wars"" program. No, there's a reason to be building this. Well take a look at this video from 2001 where a woman warns us about building space weapons and what would happen.

So this is all to bring about the fake alien invasion right/ So what happens then and what does this have to do with the mark of the beast? Did you ever wonder what the whole ""Drain the Swamp"" thing was about? It was to psychologically prepare for the NESARA act, which these supposed benevolent aliens will bring about.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA)

&gt;Harvey Francis Barnard, a Louisiana graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one ""moral evil"" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the 2nd edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.  
&gt;  
&gt;After Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and ""interdimensional"" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government.

Trump is a malignant narcissist. He is literally a hollow shell that is fueled by narcissistic supply in pursuit of having his grandiose false self reflected back to him. This is why he watches so much tv. Mostly news about himself. The only way he knows he exists is if he sees an image of himself reflected back to him like a mirror. He has to see the image of how he sees himself, his grandiose false self, reflected back to him or he chastises the mirror and tries to smash it. Since that is the case, manipulating him is very easy. Flattery is one way, especially if you are a dictator because that's who Trump respects. He looks up to them like Father figures. He thinks anyone who isn't dictator-like, is weak and stupid. Which is why he doesn't like Canada and Europe and they have become our enemies now while our former enemies have become our allies. All of the elites, the wealthy, the secret societies, the Deep State, they are just pawns that were used to set up all the laws and the globalization of the world. They are also the recognized enemy of the people aware of the NWO plot and they have used their awareness of them against them. Q has people convinced Trump is the great hero taking down the evil deep state. This is just pro wrestling to bring about the next stage of the plan. Hegelian dialectic manipulation of political events. This has all been set up so Trump can take it over in one fell swoop.

Trump has been groomed for this for decades and he was set up to be against Obama. If you look back at his earlier tweets, he actually praises Obama and then someone gave him the information about Obama not being born in America. He first talked about this at a conservative event that he was asked to speak at. After the event, he talked about how amazing the response of the crowd was. The narcissistic supply he got from that, he got addicted to and being the leader of the birthers became his new thing. This set him up to be against Obama and allowed the people who have a pathological hate for Obama (future delusional Trump supporters) to psychologically attach themselves to him long before he ever ran for President. Then they put a pseudo fake Reagan costume on him that checked off every single box of beliefs that a certain type of conservative has (mostly the Fox News watching type). They made him seem like an outsider even though he's been friends with the Clintons for decades, to even further psychologically attach conservatives to him.

Trump is just a slave to his grandiose false self and he has to obtain narcissistic supply to fuel it. If you know how to manipulate that, you can get him to do whatever you want. His supporters are literally what is fueling him. If they stop cheering him and coming to his events, he would literally change all of his beliefs in order to get that back. Why do you think he constantly talks about the size of his crowds and his ratings? Without that reaction, he has no idea who he is, he doesn't even exist.

Trump will undoubtedly incite all of his supporters to violence once his Presidency is legitimately threatened from the Mueller investigation or he might do it if the midterms don't go his way. He'll claim election rigging or something. What happens next will largely depend on how much the military and police support him but with all the immigrants they are keeping in camps, they are doing that on purpose so there is maximum chaos when the shit hits the fan. An extra 100,000 or so non-white people so the racial aspect ramps up the violence. Cue our power grid and internet being cut off and martial law will be implemented for sure. Whoever emerges the leader after the dust has settled from all of this, they will have complete control of America and it will be willingly given to them by the citizens who are left. If it isn't Trump, I'm guessing people will be clamoring for Obama to take a 3rd term.

At that point, everything associated with Trump will be demonized. Conservatism and the Republican party might as well be dead, Christianity will probably be hated because of all the nut bags that believed Trump was from God. Everyone will willingly give up their guns because the 2nd amendment was the only reason the Trump supporters were able to cause that much chaos to begin with. Plus, the tide was already shifting due to using the kids from the Parkland shooting as anti-gun spokespeople. Trump and his supporters were really the last road block to instigating a far left agenda. Trump might just be a way to get them all to show their faces and then lead them to their deaths. With them out of the way, there's nothing left to stop the leftists and the implementation of socialism. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the ""hack"" of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse.",conspiracy,1529966682,Oblique9043,117,42,True,2018-06-25

&gt;An emerging body of research suggests that many of the 1 in 4 Americans who exhibit symptoms of lactose intolerance could instead be unable to digest A1, a protein most often found in milk from the high-producing Holstein cows favored by American and some European industrial dairies. The A1 protein is much less prevalent in milk from Jersey, Guernsey, and most Asian and African cow breeds, where, instead, the A2 protein predominates.

Eggs:

&gt;So what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water. The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.

&gt;""The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,"" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient.

&gt;The coating is like a little safety vest for the egg, keeping water and oxygen in and bad bacteria out. Washing can damage that layer and ""increase the chances for bacterial invasion"" into pores or hairline cracks in the shell, according to Yi Chen, a food scientist at Purdue University. So we spray eggs with oil to prevent bacteria from getting in, and refrigerate them to keep microorganisms at bay.

1. Manipulate and narrow the range of feelings – some emotions and/or needs are deemed as evil, wrong or selfish

2. Teach emotion-stopping techniques to block feelings of homesickness, anger, doubt

3. Make the person feel that problems are always their own fault, never the leader’s or the group’s fault

4. Promote feelings of guilt or unworthiness, such as

   a. Identity guilt

   b. You are not living up to your potential

   c. Your family is deficient

   d. Your past is suspect

   e. Your affiliations are unwise

   f. Your thoughts, feelings, actions are irrelevant or selfish

   g. Social guilt

   h. Historical guilt

5. Instill fear, such as fear of:

   a. Thinking independently

   b. The outside world

   c. Enemies

   d. Losing one’s salvation

   e. Leaving or being shunned by the group

   f. Other’s disapproval

6. Extremes of emotional highs and lows – love bombing and praise one moment and then declaring you are horrible sinner

7. Ritualistic and sometimes public confession of sins

8. Phobia indoctrination: inculcating irrational fears about leaving the group or questioning the leader’s authority

   a. No happiness or fulfillment possible outside of the group

   b. Terrible consequences if you leave: hell, demon possession, incurable diseases, accidents, suicide, insanity, 10,000 
reincarnations, etc.

   c. Shunning of those who leave; fear of being rejected by friends, peers, and family

   d. Never a legitimate reason to leave; those who leave are weak, undisciplined, unspiritual, worldly, brainwashed by family or counselor, or seduced by money, sex, or rock and roll

I was not aware that r/conspiracy had enacted a rule of no redundant posting of links. When did this happen?

Do we really think the NSA is playing by the rules when it comes to surveillance on US citizens?

Question: How easy is it for the NSA to send an email with a foreign IP address that contains ""targeted words or terms"" to an email address of a US citizen that they want to collection information on? 

I'm thinking it's pretty easy for them to do...and from what I understand regarding the rules they have to follow, this is all they have to do to circumvent the surveillance laws that are meant to protect us.

Anyways, hope you read the article.

From the article:
 
""A top-secret NSA memo about the court’s ruling, which has not been disclosed before, explained that the agency was collecting people’s messages en masse if a single one were found to contain a “selector” – like an email address or phone number – that featured on a target list.

“One example of this is when a user of a webmail service accesses her inbox; if the inbox contains one email message that contains an NSA tasked selector, NSA will acquire a copy of the entire inbox, not just the individual email message that contains the tasked selector,” the memo stated""


Think about it...the article says that the NSA can legally collect ""all emails"" from a US citizen if they received an email from a country on the target list...(of which Nigeria is) and that the email contained words or terms on the target list.

Well, a Nigerian prince asking for a US citizens help in securing money for them that is held in US banks probably fucking qualifies as such...

From the article:

""At the Maryland compound, the communications collected from AT&amp;T’s networks are integrated into powerful systems called MAINWAYand MARINA, which the NSA uses to analyze metadata – such as the “to” and “from” parts of emails, and the times and dates they were sent""

Did we even have to answer the scam email in order for it to be legal for the NSA to collect all of our emails?

Because, I notice they don't actually go into too much detail as far as that part of it goes.

Anyone have an answer on that? Do I actually have to answer the ""from"" email with my own ""to"" email in order for the NSA to consider me a citizen it's legal to spy on? Would really like an answer on this.

447,Exploitation of division,"It is good strategy to exploit any weakness. The strategy of ""divide and conquer"" is one of the most successful strategies ever employed in human history. Everyone blames the perpetrators, but it is crucial to realize that this strategy only works on divided minds. When this strategy is successful, every individual believes they are a ""white knight"" battling ""demons"". 

This strategy works on populations by dividing the principles between the masculine and the feminine. Every human is born because of the union between a male and a female. The duality of this nature is as clear as night and day. Forcing the mind to choose one over the other creates an unbalance. Only through unity will humanity reach the next step in our journey. 

Until then, we will support the system of war. Either passively or actively, both are necessary.

450,Big Pharma,"The shadiness surrounding the powerful pharmaceutical companies have always been something that has interested me (being interested in the field of medicine). I find it alarming that this is hardly ever discussed with other conspiracy theories. I find it very interesting and the possibility of an agenda is certainly there.

I’ve put the link to one of my favorite videos on this subject below. It’s quite long but very informative on this subject. 

https://youtu.be/ojZn1P1CxJE

Two of the points that really hit me were the exploitation of mental health as a way to earn enormous amounts of revenue. Big Pharma is nothing more than a business with the only intention of m profits. The actual physical or mental health of the many people fed placebos and useless (sometimes harmful) drugs are hardly a concern to these people. After all, keeping someone in constant illness is the best way to maximize profit, is it not? Why cure a cancer patient when you could simply keep them in constant illness (radiation poisoning) I know claiming that the government is hiding cures is far-fetched to some, but this fundamental, unethical idea of profiting from people’s illnesses couldn’t be any more obvious. Just look at the thousands of pills and for various “mental health” conditions (which are being created left and right by bogus psychologists at each DSM revision conference). Kids as young as 4 are being prescribe medications for “bipolar disorder” for simply behaving like a normal infant: very abrupt changes in emotion. Just because a young child goes from giggling to crying doesn’t mean the child has a mental disorder, but it does now give an excuse to... guess what? GIVE 4 YEAR OLDS PILLS!!! I really wish there was more advocacy against and transparency of these unethical tactics by pharmaceutical companies

The other point is about the medical school reforms. Carnegie (a well known globalist) poured millions of dollars into medical school “reforms” early in the 20th century. Some argue that, rather, his goal was to eliminate all forms of natural medicine and indoctrinate future medical students to only solutions based on pharmaceuticals. Maybe he did just organize medical school curriculums with good intentions, but many believe that his mission was to make western medicine degenerate. I haven’t been through med school, but it seems like topics such as ethics in medicine, herbal/natural based medicines, etc. are completely ignored. These days, doctors only seem to know how to do one thing: prescribe drugs on drugs on drugs.

Please feel free to share your thoughts on this. Perhaps correct me or provide me with new insight!

2. Kanye being an African-American will hold on to his masculinity a lot longer than Bruce (It's a lot easier for a white man to turn into a woman than it is for a black man). He'll hopefully die a man. Why do you think the Kardashians date only black men? Because its impossible for them to date white men (they ain't gonna be men for long). Kanye's bipolar disorder getting worse could very well be a very early indicator of bi-gender disorder. If Kanye becomes a woman before he dies, I'm a fucking prophet.
3. Tristan Thomas, Travis Scott - They don't spend that much time in the Kardashian-World. Their dicks might be safe. But you never know for sure.
4. The Kardasian-World is a carefully crafted world that revolves around men's desire to fuck them. They gained fame by marketing that desire and got filthy rich. Any man stupid enough to dwell in that world will be poisoned by wanting to taste that fruit.

495,Life After Death,"Heaven or hell, and reincarnation, happen to every life-form, and death is just a minor passage.

Upon death, we will witness an abstraction that is either good or bad; it can be considered heaven or hell, where our wants or what we don't want is cast in dream form, lasting from days to years.

After this abstraction we are reincarnated, and we exist some place in accordance with how we were judged.

The post-life-abstraction is also a judgement phase; whether it lasts for days or years, at the end of it we are enlightened by the character that we were, either knowing that we were evil or that we were good, then we are reincarnated.

We are judged by what each part of ourselves means metaphorically. 

For example, if you're a heavy smoker it can be said that you are unknowingly motherless, because you spend most of life harming your heart, which is metaphorically your mother organ, especially in junction with your lungs. Therefore, in the next life you will be, look or seem like a man who is heartless.

For example, if you were terribly evil. In your abstraction you may be disgusted beyond what's normal, and then you're reborn into the hell side of whatever universe you deserve.

We are judged by a higher creative intelligence, it can learn all your data in a single dream, and can instantly acknowledge your morality. 

Upon death, this higher creative intelligence is your temporary world, where the activity described earlier occurs.

I'm happy about death because I did good with my eyes; I studied optical illusions and made some good dreams, hallucinations, and more. I helped nature grow and proved that my genes were potent. Still, though, I'm a heavy smoker, so I expect to be heartless unless I can sing a beautiful song for the rest of my years.

Though you may think that you can eat hundreds of pigs a year and get away without punishment, it is a morally evil act, and you will be punished because of morality unless you can solve that equation before you die an evil animal.

What the non-believer in good and evil thinks is that he/she is not held accountable for and nothing keeps his/her record, but he/she is wrong, a good sense of the world and universe shows us that lot's of things keep your record.

As long as there is life force, there'll be the equivalent of a white hole above us at all times, to counter-act the black holes.

Now, it's not possible to prove in words what proves itself to our senses; in dreams, we witness an outer body experience, where we make use of a fraction of or a full white hole; another higher power, like a planet is to an animal, is present in a dream state.

This is actually advanced evidence of a white hole that can be used to prove afterlife to any sensory being, but, again, it cannot be proven with words.

1,"Conspiracy SOLVED! Woody Allen isn't a pedophile. Mia Farrow's son, Moses, posts online confession about his mother's horrific abusive nature &amp; how she LIED about Woody Allen being a pedophile.","I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention. But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.

I was present for everything that transpired in our house before, during, and after the alleged event. Now that the public hysteria of earlier this year has died down a little and I have some hope that the truth can get a fair hearing, I want to share my story.

http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.my/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html?m=1

**Excerpts:**

- On the surface, it was not unlike his previous visits to our country home. But my mother had put all of us on notice not to let him out of our sight. She was understandably furious: seven months earlier she had learned that he was in an intimate relationship with my 21-year-old sister Soon-Yi, after discovering Polaroids of her in Woody’s apartment. For months now, she had been drilling it into our heads like a mantra: Woody was “evil,” “a monster,” “the devil,” and Soon-Yi was “dead to us.” This was the constant refrain, whether or not Woody was around. (So often did she repeat it that Satchel would announce to one of our nannies, “My sister is fucking my father.” He had just turned four.) My mother was our only source of information about Woody – and she was extremely convincing.

- Even people who doubt Dylan’s claims of assault, often cling to Woody’s relationship with Soon-Yi as justification for their skepticism about him. The public attacks on Soon-Yi by complete strangers still stagger me, as does the general misinformation that so many people consider fact. She is not Woody’s daughter (adopted, step, or otherwise), nor is she developmentally challenged. (She got a master’s degree in special education from Columbia University!) ***And the claim that they started dating while she was underage is totally false.***

- My mother, of course, had her own darkness. She married 50-year-old Frank Sinatra when she was only 21. After they divorced, she moved in to live with her close friend Dory Previn and her husband André. When my mother became pregnant by André, the Previns’ marriage broke up, leading to Dory’s institutionalization. It was never spoken of in our home, of course, and not even known to me until a few years ago. But, as I look at it – as a licensed therapist as well as an eyewitness – it’s easy to see the seeds of dysfunction that would flourish within our own home.

- I’m sure my mother had good intentions in adopting children with disabilities from the direst of circumstances, but the reality inside our walls was very different. **It pains me to recall instances in which I witnessed siblings, some blind or physically disabled, dragged down a flight of stairs to be thrown into a bedroom or a closet, then having the door locked from the outside. She even shut my brother Thaddeus, paraplegic from polio, in an outdoor shed overnight as punishment for a minor transgression.**

- When Soon-Yi was young, Mia once threw a large porcelain centerpiece at her head. Luckily it missed, but the shattered pieces hit her legs. Years later, Mia beat her with a telephone receiver. Soon-Yi’s made it clear that her desire was simply to be left alone, which increasingly became the case. Even if her relationship with Woody was unconventional, it allowed her to escape. Others weren’t so lucky.

- Most media sources claim my sister Tam died of “heart failure” at the age of 21. In fact, Tam struggled with depression for much of her life, a situation exacerbated by my mother refusing to get her help, insisting that Tam was just “moody.” One afternoon in 2000, after one final fight with Mia, which ended with my mother leaving the house, **Tam committed suicide by overdosing on pills.** My mother would tell others that the drug overdose was accidental, saying that Tam, who was blind, didn’t know which pills she was taking. But Tam had both an ironclad memory and sense of spatial recognition. And, of course, blindness didn’t impair her ability to count.

- Just two years ago, Thaddeus also committed suicide by shooting himself in his car, less than 10 minutes from my mother’s house.

- For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand.

- That was the start of her coaching, drilling, scripting, and rehearsing – in essence, brainwashing. I became anxious and fearful. Once, when I was given a new pair of jeans, I thought they would look cool if I cut off a couple of the belt loops. When Mia saw what I had done, she spanked me repeatedly and had me remove all my clothing, saying, “You’re not deserving of any clothes” and making me stand naked in the corner of her room, in front of my older siblings who had just returned from dinner with their father André. (After I spoke to People magazine in 2014 about how I was treated, Dylan called it a “betrayal” and said that I was “dead to” her. She later publicly dismissed my recollections of my childhood as “irrelevant.” ***This from a woman who now styles herself an “advocate for abuse victims***.”)",conspiracy,1527174835,Itsbbbitch,66,0,True,2018-05-24

16,The Mauve Lodge: a Confession.,"There exists among us a unseen force. A group lurking forever in the shadows of every profession. The Mauve Lodge. What is the Mauve Lodge? They are the most elusive and most mysterious of all secret societies in history. Hundreds of historical figures throughout the past four hundred years, from Aaron Burr to David Bowie, have been members knowingly or unknowingly of the Mauve Lodge. Their reach extends from Berlin to Beijing. They are the true international masters.

The delicately gloved hand of the Mauve Lodge is Smith's invisible hand. The prime mover in the unseen workings of our world economy. Before the collapse of feudalism to progress rule was centralized to small kingdoms. The European example held that property would be passed down in family lines. To keep large kingly holdings from being divided a great deal of interbreeding took place among the elite of Europe. This had very detrimental consequences to the genome of these ancient blood lines. In time the great families of Europe could not longer maintain their success with the disgenic effects of inbreeding taking hold. To ensure the success of these established fortunes a secret group began governing from the shadows. The group today known as the Mauve Lodge arose from the ranks of Europe's great households, but not its ""great"" bloodlines, these members of influence are a society of ""servants."" 

I have received a snippet of their initiation rituals that I will leak here. Much of the sample I was given has been destroyed but a idea of their organization can be glimpsed from these fragments. 

""Open the eye of the autumn's pillar.

Step forward unto the Mauve glow

Face the Goddess. Beglove thy hand. 

The initiate takes seven steps into the light and a figure of a chicken is thrown on the rostrum. Silver platter in hand the initiate must perform a improvised tap dance to the accompaniment of the Mauve band. A reenactment of the great founders acts of mediation are enacted through interpretive dance. Then upon a successful performance the tap shoes are ritualistically burned... Upon completion the initiate is ritualistically bathed in oil and a ""servants"" feast is had.""

The next section is so badly damaged I am not sure I can publish it. But it seems to depict further tasks related to acting, singing, and hosting. In adition to being a good host the member of the mauve hand must be what is known in the acting world as a triple threat; I.e. actor, singer, dancer. This will ensure that they will be ready for any circumstances that may arise.

This society has existed for millennia in their own literature but we have traced back the actual origin to the writing of an alchemical text published in approximately 1611 called ""The Hand Servants Guide to the Mauve Arts; as passed down from Henri Francois Fabinio IV"". In which the essential guide to maintaining a civilization is laid out disguised, of course, as the instructions given to a house servant. Any great peace treaty, business deal between nations, unification, and even major war, has had the invisible influences from the Mauve Lodge acting upon it. Though they act in the shadows they are among us. You may know a member but not know it... If you ever see a cloth napkins folded into a dodecahedron then you will know they are there. Every important function with dignitaries from across the world has been infiltrated by this organization. They are the deal makers. The negotiators. The true fixers. The Mauve Lodge is the true elite, making the deals while the ""elite"" in name only have genetically degenerated to the point that many simply drool their days away in a sedated haze.

It may surprise you to hear but this organization is more powerful than ever in the past. The Mauve Lodge has succeed in subverting the Black Lodge and directing its efforts towards different ends.

28,Political veganism and the silent deaths of trillions of animals across the planet as a result of the production of vegan-friendly foods.,"On an animal to animal basis, vegan-friendly food production kills more animals than the meat industry. Yet we never hear this from the well funded vegan groups out there. Why?

Imagine you're a ground hog just minding your own business teaching your ground hog babies to forage. It's a sunny day, the dew drops are just drying from the foliage surrounding you, and life is great. You think you hear some thunder in the distance, is it going to rain? That would be nice. More rain means more delicious plants for you and your peaceful ground hog family to munch on. You happily turn around to munch on some leaves, and in a split second a vegan-friendly combine harvester comes barreling through your ground hog utopia and rips your furry little family to shreds. You still hear their screams from the churning blades as the harvest continues without the slightest hesitation.

Next to you is a new family of butterflies who are on the verge of being endangered due to the all the insecticides used to protect the vegan food supply, drying their wings in the sun so they can fly off and save their species. But that cold heartless heavy machinery supporting the vegan way of life does not care for butterflies, and with one rotation of its spinning blades those beautiful creatures are wiped out of existence. What must it be like for a ground hog to witness the vegan way of life as it actually appears in nature?

While the meat industry has adopted a standard of providing livestock a merciful end, there is no such accepted standard in vegan food production where the majority of animals killed by human food production actually die. Wild animals who have known freedom their whole life are drawn to vegan foods by their very nature and are killed on an industrial scale, and for what? Nobody is eating them. Their life isn't respected in the same way a hunter respects the animals he hunts and feeds his family. Their deaths don't provide a main source of funding to protect the ecosystem as hunting does. They aren't given the chance to feel no pain like the beef industry provides cattle. Nobody is talking about these victims of veganism. Vegans aren't pointing out that if more people ate hamburgers and less people ate grains, less animals would die unnecessary deaths. Why?

As a ground hog, if you could petition anyone in humanity, you might call on the vegans to save you. But what do you do when the vegans are the very ones promoting the industrial slaughter of your species, and countless other species as well? You might wonder why none of the vegan literature mentions this. You might question why out of all the protests vegans engage in, they never criticize the biggest source of human-caused animal deaths... the one thing they directly benefit from with each and every meal they eat.

&gt;On Sunday Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, will arrive in Washington, hoping to persuade Trump to keep the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA).

&gt;Straw, who was foreign secretary between 2001 and 2006, said: “The campaign against the JCPOA has been characterised by abuse and misinformation. It is the best chance of ensuring Iran never develops a nuclear weapons programme, and it is insane to suggest abandoning the deal could do anything but endanger international security.”

72,Sandy Hook was the most obvious hoax shooting to ever occur in the history of the world.,"The school had no internet activity since 2008. Hundreds of students who supposedly evacuated the school were nowhere to be found in any of the photos, we only see the same 15 or so children walking in a line unperturbed except for one girl who looks like she just found out that Santa Claus isn't real. Mold growing all over the school, water damage in the halls from flooding, no wheelchair ramps so not ADA compliant. Fake crying from Gene Rosen, who had several different stories as to what he encountered that day. Robbie Parker laughing/smiling before approaching the podium, followed by hyperventilating and getting into character before he mourns the death of Emily Parker, his 6 year old daughter who died the day before. Donation pages online before the event occurred. Sandy Hook parents visiting the White House before the event occurred. Thousands of houses in Newtown, CT paid off on Christmas Day three years prior. The FBI admitting on there own website that zero deaths occurred by way of manslaughter in Newtown, CT that year. This is all just the tip of the iceberg as anyone who has really dug into this knows. Watch [Dear Wolfgang Revisiting Sandy Hook](https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=KB6MU3HS9WAK), [Sandy Hook Line and Sinker](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56fnjy), and [We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook](https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=K8N4RW23K4HR). Given the recent news of the lawsuit against the controlled opposition Zio-shill cointelpro agent Alex Jones regarding Sandy Hook (which I believe to be a government psyop in itself) there has been an influx of people, either paid trolls or perhaps useful idiots, shilling for the official narrative given to them by the mainstream mockingbird CIA whore media. Don't let anyone try to gaslight you into feeling bad about exposing this most obvious false flag hoax. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out if they simply watch the documentaries on it. Be warned that anyone who is challenged to do so will likely respond with something like ""lol your proof is a youtube video, that doesn't count!"" I'm sad to say that I have lost friendships over this event and I think we should all be pissed that the government is causing such strain in people's lives with their friends and family by conducting these sorts of fake shootings in order to chisel away at our rights. And yes, I realize no huge change happened in regards to gun laws after Sandy Hook- they are chiseling away at it though. They can't just do it all at once, but they'll point to all these events and say, ""see what's happened now? First Sandy Hook, then the Boston Bombing, now this?? Enough is enough!"" I personally really got into researching conspiracies when Pizzagate broke, but when I learned about Sandy Hook and saw just how obvious it was from every conceivable angle, it makes me feel as though this may be the best way we have to expose the truth about how corrupt the US government is to the sleeping masses.

74,Is China sabotaging Australian telco network in bid to win new 5G contract?,"Join the dots, if you will ...

- A fire in a Telstra pit caused widespread outage of Telstra's emergency phone line in Australia.
- Soon after, there were major outages to Telstra's 3G and 4G phone systems
- All this comes after the USA is kicking Chinese telcos out of business, like ZTE.
- China is currently trying to win a 5G contract in Australia.

What does all this mean? Maybe, given the US crackdown on Chinese telcos, China is pro-actively sabotaging the Australian network to increase its chances of winning the 5G contract.

Chines does have a covert war doctrine called Unrestricted Warfare, and there are 1.2 million Chinese immigrants in Australia - no doubt including countless sleeper agents.

It's all speculation but when it comes to China, these are the folks who gave us The Art of War.

A similar question might be raised over the bus fires in Sydney and Rome, maybe China is sabotaging old infrastructure in hopes of selling shiny new buses to these countries.

So this is just a theory, but for the past year I haven’t been able to open reddit without seeing at least one negative post about Donald Trump mostly on r/politics or r/worldnews with a disproportionate amount of upvotes. 

I’ve been looking at the accounts posting these and almost all of them have only been posting anti trump posts and comments all with a surprisingly large number of upvotes.

I have experience working on large scale influencing campaigns and what’s been going on on reddit the past year has all of the signs a very elaborate one.

I don’t want to single out any specific party that would be interested in such a large scale influencing campaign against Trump as there are many, but in my opinion it is blatantly obvious that there is one going on and that the whole Reddit community is falling for it and playing into the hands of the people who are running the campaign.

Music, games, drinking a few beers with their mates on weekends... these are the kinds of things they want to do with their time, but they feel like they rarely get to be who they want to be, because they are too busy 'being a good dad/husband'.

This usually means doing as they are told by their manager at work ('can't afford to lose my job, too many bills to pay') and their wife at home ('happy wife, happy life').

These men usually get very little say in how their own children are raised. The school has FAR more say in what the child believes than the father.

Why is it a man's job to work his ass off, and give up on his own passions and hopes, to pay for a family (who often do not respect his opinion)? Who convinced us that this is fair or reasonable? And why are the men on TV shows portrayed as idiots, people to be disrespected? Is it a coincidence?

The amazing thing is that I also know several men who only work part-time but have more moey to spend on what they want than the men described above. Why? No family to worry about, so they are able to live frugally and peacefully. Nobody 'needs' to work full time *unless* other people (i.e. the family) are spending the money they are earning.

You can also see the full post on my comment history. Here it is again lol

The Myth of Dinosaurs the Reality of Dragons by Ben Armstrong
Do you realize that dinosaurs are just a theory? A theory that is backed up by very shaky evidence. Most people believe in dinosaurs because they are taught in school about them. Rarely does a school teach the children that dinosaurs are just a theory and are not proven to be fact. What if I were to tell you Dinosaurs are actually a myth? That very statement will cause many of you to laugh. That's because you have been taught that dinosaurs were real and you never have challenged that belief. I know this because if you challenge that belief, you will not conclude that dinosaurs are real. You will conclude that dinosaurs are only a theory.
The long recorded history of Dragons has been swapped out by the theory of dinosaurs. When did this happen? Well it all started in recent history, 1842 to be exact. Before 1842 everyone referred to these fossilized bones as dragon bones. Did you even know that? One man named Sir Richard Owen created the term dinosaur in 1842. Dinosaur simply means terrible lizard. Understand, no one, in all of world history, believed there were dinosaurs before 1842. Everyone believed in the historical evidence of dragons. That's because almost every single cultural around the world has historical evidence of dragons. You can check out this article from BBC. Sir Richard Owen: The man who invented the dinosaur.
Is it interesting that after this term was created, all of a sudden the first dinosaur discovery happens in 1858. Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences member, William Foulke excavated the first so-called dinosaur. It was a nearly-complete skeleton, only missing its head. A little fact that indicates that man killed this animal. Only men, when killing an animal, take only the head. The skeleton resembles many early drawings of dragons interestingly enough. But, to make the skeleton look bigger when it was on tour, William Foulke stood it up on its hind legs in a T-Rex position. If this skeleton had been found just 17 years earlier, before 1842, it would have been concluded that they were dragon bones. What a difference just a few years can make.
Sir Richard Owen, who created the term dinosaur, was an evolutionist. Many in the science community at this time we're trying to disprove what the Bible taught. They wanted to prove Evolution to be true. They found out that many in the scientific community embraced the same goal. Besides, it was a good way to make money. Think of the billions of dollars the dinosaur industry generates today.
History before 1842 clearly states that dragons existed. One culture still today laughs at Western scientists when they Proclaim these bones are dinosaur bones. That culture is China. Many scientists in China TODAY believe that these fossilized bones are dragon bones. China also has the largest recorded history of dragons. Our scientists want us to believe that the recorded history throughout China is simply fantasy. But did you know the number one place for our scientists to find so-called dinosaur bones is in China. That is because More Dragons lived in China and India than anywhere else. So it makes sense that this would be the #1 place to find Dino bones.
The Chinese believe that dragon bones have a medical healing use, and actually consume dragon bone powders. Our scientists have proclaimed that those bones are prehistorical and cannot be used as medicine. There is an actual conflict going on between our two cultures. Read this article from the Associated Press back in 2007. Chinese Eat Dinosaur Bones As Medicine Many of you are still laughing at this article. That's probably because you don't even know what a fossil is. So what exactly is a fossil? It is bone that is turned into rock. There's actually no possible way to determine the difference between a regular Rock and a fossilized bone. If you were to test a dinosaur bone, it would just be the same as a rock. Fascinating how so many dinosaur bones are found in actual rock bed. How can anyone prove that these scientists didn't just carve out a bone shape from the rocks?
Don't you find it fascinating that when these scientists go out looking for dinosaur bones they usually find them. They have to, or else they won't continue to get funding if they keep coming up empty-handed every time. How come nobody accidentally comes across dinosaur bones when digging in their backyard? If you think you found one, they will quickly tell you that it's not. But they stumble on them all the time when they decide to look for them. I challenge you to go out and find some dinosaur bones. You will fail, but they will always succeed. Well, that because they are experts and you are not, don't you know.
Did you know that the skeletons in museums are almost always fake. They will even admit to this fact. They will tell you that it's a replica. They will tell you not to worry, the real bones are hidden away where nobody can actually see them. Why can't they just display the bones that they find? It's not because they're too rare, they could just put them behind glass casing. It's because, if they use the real fossilized bones, they will hardly have any skeleton to show you. They make up most of the dinosaurs through artistic design. But don't worry folks, even though you cannot see, feel, touch, or examine any of these bones, just trust them. Isn't that what you've been taught to do? Here's what's really interesting. I can make the case that any dinosaur fossils that they find are simply dragon bones. There are many historical accounts describing different types of dragons. Some have the long necks with the fat body, some are snake like. Some have wings and some do not. European culture documents dragons as fact. Ancient Chinese culture documents dragons as fact. The Bible documents dragons as fact.
So what happened to the dragons? They simply went extinct like many other species have. We even know the reason why they went extinct. Historical records show that dragons like to live in caves. They also show that dragons like to eat sheep. Dragons Were a threat to many farmers and their livestock. You have heard of the term Dragon Hunter haven't you? That's because they were actual dragon Hunters in history. Farmers in a town would have a dragon problem, where a Dragon was attacking their livestock, they would pay someone to slay the Dragon. This depleted the numbers of dragons and they eventually went extinct. Wolves almost went extinct in America for the same reason.
There is historical records that Dragons were real, but only theories about Dinosaurs.

186,"Fighting for our Health: The Montreal Accord, Air Conditioner Refrigerants... and Fluoride","Not too long ago, R-22 (Freon) was banned.. circa 2010. You may or may not know that. If you get a system, get a portable AC, a window, or other... it will either come with r-410A or r-32. 


While Freon had a form of fluoride in it... these newer ones with a ""smaller"" footprint and much less ozone depletion... may have a secret intention.


Personally, I've been sick as hell with my AC on, I am burping up a soap bubble taste, with constant headaches where one might find their pineal gland... Put all this together and yes, the fluoride in this r-410A gas is making me sick!


I wanted to post this and get the opinion of others... who may be paying attention as much as I do to the world around them. I think it is super sneaky they have developed ways of giving us massive doses of fluoride without water... since it seems as a herd we have caught on to that. 
r-410a - difluoromethane and pentafluoroethane 
r-410a made me super sick.
from a chem site:
Much like we were told for so long that fluoride was good for our teeth... perhaps there is more here that necessitates digging as well. 
r-32 difluoromethane only. I am still waiting... but I am feeling sick over a few hours. 
r-22 Chlorodifluoromethane 


The argument goes that the chlorine had bonded with the gas, and it would float up into the atmosphere and the UV radiation at a high altitude would destroy the bond and cause it to dissipate there... causing destruction of the Ozone. At the time as well, there was much dissent to this argument, just like ""Global Warming"" has been challenged now.
I would love to hear someone with a background in this topic on both sides... as I am sure someone favoring the Montreal Accord as well as r-32 and r-410a will find there way here.
I will finally add that as a country not take health lightly... Germany has rebelled a bit on this and has been pushing for c02 air conditioners. 
My drastic reaction may be a result of the last 18 years having a strict almost religious refusal of all fluoride. (Sitting on the toilet right now... tmi I know) 


Regardless, this is probably going to be talked about in the next 5 years like we used to talk about water. I encourage an open dialogue on it.

189,"Every time I see the news, it steals my attention for a while and then hours later I realize that TPTB won another war and the majority of the public didn't even know there was a fight. The media is bombarded with so much ""news"" the conspiracy story comes and goes before anyone notices it happened.","When something big comes to light, whether it's government corruption, a massive pedophile ring, terrorist and ""terrorist"" attacks, human experimentation and well as human rights violations, attention grabbing stories flood the media. We are all aware of it and its purpose. A news story breaks about how the government is involved in illegal experimentation on the military. It's a huge story. Several individuals risked their careers and their lives to blow the whistle as well as get the story out there. And then all of a sudden. Two a-list celebrities are outed as sexual predators. There's stories, witnesses, and all sorts of evidence. Boom, conspiracy is out of the news cycle. Well, for people like us it wasn't good enough. We still tracked the conspiracy. We still talked about it and investigated it. We told everyone that was willing to listen. Sure, the general public weren't seeing the original report anymore, but it wasn't completely covered up. 

Fast forward to today. I feel like there's a new strategy. Sure, it's always been better to keep your conspiracy hidden, but when that fails to be an option, what do they do? They flood the media. There's too many potential conspiracies, too many stories being broken. The story hits the news cycle and there's a fresh batch of conspiracy stories as well as celebrity sexual predator stories and school shootings all right behind one another. They've made it impossible to not only discuss the conspiracy issues but to keep track of everything that's happening. 

Sure, we try our best to keep talking about and investigating potential conspiracies, but when we are limited in our news outlets and the majority of people lose interest or have their attention shifted to another story our resources are negligent. 

There's half a dozen potential conspiracies from the Vegas shooting up until now. And in the same time period how many school shootings, celebrity sexual predators, war in the middle east, a royal wedding, NK/SK peace talks, have taken place? How many of those stories really warrant our attention? Not to mention the disinformation campaigns that take place, as well as the normal astroturfing that takes place do discredit any facts that may come to light.

So, what am I getting at? There's just too much going on. They used to try and hide a story forever, and when it came out it would be big news and they'd try to downplay it by bringing up how many years ago it took place. Well now, the conspiracy is fresh, but as soon as we find out about it five, ten other topics hit the news cycle. The ink is barely dry on the conspiracy story by the time they start printing up the new stories. I don't even know what to do at this point. I'll bring up a news story I saw about a conspiracy and there's a good chance the people I'm talking to either didn't see it or only heard about it in passing. I will keep investigating and spreading knowledge, but it feels like its even more of a struggle than it was 2-3 years ago.

190,Can we please all agree on one thing! [pizzagate!],"So I am sick and tired of this very specific conversation:

- ""pizzagate is real""  
- ""oh so you think Hillary raped and tortured countless children in a pizzaplace in Washington DC? Yeah sure man"" 

NO. For fucks sake, no one ever said that in the first place, and no one actually believes this kind a statement at all. ""The Washington Post mentioned that in their article once news about pizzagate broke free, and that's when all this stuff began to become badmouthed as a conspiracy shit. 

So let's get the facts straight:

- In the Podesta Mails, some anons found weird wordings and phrases. These phrases were said to be code for pedophiles, which could most likely be fake. HOWEVER:
- These mails mentioned Comet Ping Pong as a place, where one could meet up. This made a few anons study this very specific pizza place. 
- They found the owner of this very specific pizza place, James Alefantis, to have been posting some rather **weird pictures** of children.
- Some of them were taped to a table, and didn't look too happy
- Some pics of babies were titled as ""whore"" 
- Some other weird pics from that instagram page raised a few anons eyebrow. 
- an allegedly leaked FBI document of pedophile symbols did lead to a inspection of the symbols of each shop around that pizza place, after these very symbols were found within the logo and menu of comet ping pong. 
- **wether these symbols are real or not, doesn't matter for this place to at least having had left a weird impression on the anons doing the research**

-Satanic symbols were found in a room within comet ping-pong and the logo, too. 

- The ""Finders"", ""Dutroux Affair"" alongside the ""Franklin Coverup"" came to the mind of anons. All these cases were **proven to be an appearance in the past of pedophilia connected to satanism and politicians or at least elitist members of the society**

- **Any further research from this point should have not been discredited in the way we actually have seen it been to. **


TL;DR: pizzagate is not about Hillary raping children in a basement of a pizzaplace, but this very specific pizza place was found to be lead by a person that posted photos of children in relation to sexual meanings, as well as photos of children that didn't look very comfortable taped on a table. While one can argue about the symbolism, these facts alone should have legalized any further research without any doubt, as this is an absolutely improper behavior towards minors.

With simple folk,  
and life of toil and boredom.  
A life without a mask or makeup –  
a vicious snarling dog.  

&gt;And you must tirelessly grapple,  
and you must endlessly persist,  
to extract from the teeth of this bristling, raging beast  
a piece of bread.  

&gt;Slapping belts in the shed,  
screeching shafts overhead,  
and the air is so stale  
you can't easily  
deeply  
inhale.  

&gt;But not too far's the spring breeze   
it rocks the fields, the sun calls...  
And the trees, they are all leaning skyward,  
but their shade hits the factory's walls.  

&gt;But how it's foreign and unneeded,  
how totally forgotten is this field!  

&gt;*THEIR* hand has thrown away the idyll  
and the blue sky with its promised dreams.  

&gt;And to stray for a second  
or to soften your heart,  
is to lose to no purpose your strong worker's arm.  

&gt;You must shout in the clatter  
and din of machines  
so your words can pass freely all the spaces between.  

&gt;And I shouted for years,  
an eternity even.  
I gathered the others did too:  
the factory, and the machines  
and the man  
in the farthest, darkest room.  

&gt;And this shout forged an alloy of steel,  
and we armored our life with its plate.  
Just try putting a spoke in our wheel,  
it's your own hand that you'll break.  

&gt;You, factory, still seek to blind us  
with layers and layers of soot.  
In vain! You have taught us to struggle  
so that down to us we can bring the sun.  

&gt;So many toil-blackened faces  
under your tyranny smart.  
But one heart within you tirelessly  
pulsates with a thousand hearts.

192,Control of language is nothing compared to control of discussion.,"I don't post here all that often. In fact I believe my last post here was a plea for people to start looking out for one another and that was a few years ago, boy isn't it funny how time changes things!

Controlling language used to be a huge concern, and rightly so as it inhibits discussion from taking place. But I feel that threat is being overshadowed, or at least upgraded into a new ""game"" that I can't keep from seeing, everywhere. Seriously, almost every subreddit is filled with it and this one is no exception.

People are being taught NOT to discuss ideas with one another, be it by media talking heads, peer pressure, or a multitude of other reasons. This has some damning consequences for everyone, even those not involved, against, or for said ideas. When we stagnate discussion of ideological differences the actual growth of ideas itself is stagnated and what comes from that terrible arrangement? Echo Chambers.

How often do you see a negative view of the president get taken seriously on T_D? How often do you see a negative view of the left in Politics get examined? Now those are pretty easy targets I'll admit, but the thing that really amazed me about this trend was it's effect here, in a subreddit that draws folks from both the left, right, and everywhere in between.

Quite a few discussions here end on the same note:

""Oh, your post history shows me you hold an idea that differs from my own, this means I don't have to listen to you""

I mean, hell, if everyone stating that obviously neutralized paraphrasing was correct then this subreddit (and moreso Reddit as a whole) would be full of nothing but CTR and Russia shills. Surely this is madness we all can recognize right?

I understand this might not be the right place to post this, but some of the best discussions, comment threads, and insight of my life have been gained through this subreddit and I'd hate to see that go the way of the dodo simply because we refuse to listen, abstain from talking, and negate discussion as a whole.

214,The Nayirah Testimony – How Propaganda Shifted U.S Position on the Gulf War,"Throughout the 1980s, Saddam Hussein and Iraq was a key ally of the U.S even receiving U.S support during the Iran-Iraq war through the 80s despite the advice of human rights watch groups. In August 1990 Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein began the invasion of Kuwait, most likely as a reason to reduce debt from the Iran-Iraq war. Following this invasion, the U.N denounced Iraq. The U.S moved to prepare for a counter invasion of their major Middle East allies with operation Desert Shield pending Congress approval. However still reeling from the public fallout from the Vietnam War and the prospect of going to war against their ally, the American citizen’s sentiment as well as the position of some congressmen on invasion was rather hesitant. This was until October of the year, when the brave and heart wrenching [testimony]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y) of a 15 year old, Nayirah (identified without last name to protect family in Kuwait), a volunteer in a large Kuwaiti Hospital, on the inhumane treatment by Iraqi soldiers was witnessed in front of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. According to the testimony, during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, human rights abuses by the soldiers ran rampant. This culminated in a harrowing tale of how Nayirah had personally witnessed 22 babies being ripped from their incubators and killed by their Iraqi captors. This testimony was even culminated by human rights watch group, Amnesty International based purely on the testimony and not on ground evidence. 


This had a profound emotional impact on not just U.S President, George H.W. Bush but also on the congressmen opposing the war as well as the general public. Bush even uses the 22 babies statistic during his war rallies and the subject was intensely debated during congress’s sessions on the same topic. [53%] (http://news.gallup.com/poll/1963/americans-believe-us-participation-gulf-war-decade-ago-worthwhile.aspx) of the citizens in favor of the war following this testimony up from 41% prior to the testimony. The U.S eventually entered the war first through aerial assault and then ground invasion with the U.N also approving military invasion less than a month after the testimony. The approval rate for the war continued to grow peaking at 80% in January, 1991 and ending at 66% just following the end of the war in February, 1992. The approval rate for Bush also grew to 88% during this war. However there was just one issue with this testimony – it was all propaganda to drive the U.S to war.


Following the end of the war, investigative reporters, especially the New York Times’ John MacArthur and ABC news reporters, started looking into the girl behind the testimony – the person who had such a profound shift in the U.S war approval rating. It turns out the 15 year old Nayirah was actually Nayirah al-Sabah, the daughter of Kuwati royal Saud al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the U.S. Nayirah was then living with her father in [Washington D.C]( https://rodcroskery.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/nayirah-al-sabah-where-is-she-now/) and was likely not working in a hospital Kuwait during the time when the invasion occurred. CIA personnel even [coached]( https://sites.psu.edu/shivensblog/2014/03/20/cia-using-a-false-witness/) Nayirah’s testimony to push the war.


The testimony was largely a PR effort by the [Citizens for a Free Kuwait]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_a_Free_Kuwait) an astroturf organization established by the Kuwait Government to push pro-war sentiments against the Iraq invasion of Kuwait. This organization paid around $10.8 million to the then largest public relations firm [Hill and Knowlton](http://paulmartinlester.info/Kuwait_Case_Study.pdf) as well as another $1.1 million to 20 other public relation firms including Rendon Group and Neill and Co. $11.9 million of CFK’s funding was supplied by the Kuwait government while the organization generated just $17,861 from other individuals. Documents filed with the US Department of Justice showed that 119 H&amp;K executives in 12 offices across the US were overseeing the Kuwait account. The man running Hill &amp; Knowlton's Washington office was Craig Fuller, one of Bush's closest friends and inside political advisors. According to [O'Dwyer's PR Services]( https://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html)  before the war began: ""Craig L. Fuller, chief of staff to Bush when he was vice-president, has been on the Kuwaiti account at Hill &amp; Knowlton since the first day. He and [Bob] Dilenschneider at one point made a trip to Saudi Arabia, observing the production of some 20 videotapes, among other chores. The Wirthlin Group, research arm of H&amp;K, was the pollster for the Reagan Administration. Wirthlin has reported receiving $1.1 million in fees for research assignments for the Kuwaitis. Robert K. Gray, Chairman of H&amp;K/USA based in Washington, DC had leading roles in both Reagan campaigns. He has been involved in foreign nation accounts for many years. ... Lauri J. Fitz-Pegado, account supervisor on the Kuwait account, is a former Foreign Service Officer at the US Information Agency who joined Gray when he set up his firm in 1982."" Pentagon Spokesmen, Lobbyists, Congressmen as well as the President of NPR were all under H&amp;K’s discretion for pushing public opinion on the war.


A majority of the funding went through a single source – [Sam Zakhem]( http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-08/news/mn-1422_1_persian-gulf) , a former U.S ambassador to Bahrain along with two executives from Conservative Digest ($7.7m) through two front organizations “Coalition for Americans at Risk” and “Freedom Task Force”. He was later indicted for his role in purporting the Kuwaiti propaganda. Representative Tom Lantos, a co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus knew the identity of the girl and kept it [hidden]( https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/15/opinion/deception-on-capitol-hill.html). Despite pushing the propaganda Tom Lantos as well as the other politicians from H&amp;K have not been held unaccountable and have continued to serve public office. Amnesty International and Middle East Watch, another human rights organization upon entering Kuwait following the war were not able to corroborate Nayirah’s story with local doctors expressing that she was lying (Unfortunately doctors and nurses had fled the hospitals after the Iraqi invasion so the babies did die but it had nothing to do with Iraqi troops). While the Gulf war would likely have happened with or without Nariyah’s testimony, it is important to understand how a single piece of propaganda can effect public opinion on war to such a degree. I thought this propaganda was particularly relevant with Israel’s push for a war on Iran.

I saw a post the other day about Melatonin secretion taking place between 11PM and 1AM and schools beginning at 8AM or 9AM; school start times prevent students from getting enough sleep. which effects their grades and permanently damages them,"The average American slept 9 hours/night in 1900. In 2000 the average American slept 6.1 hours/night. 

Children 9 - 17 need 10 hours of sleep a day. 

Studies suggest adults 18 - 30 need 8 hours of sleep a night with the ideal amount being 6 full sleep cycles (9 hours). 

Short term sleep loss can be recovered if one has a week of sleeping for 5 hours and making up for it on the weekend. However for most this is a chronic issue. 

Some researchers say if you build up more than twenty hours of sleep debt you may not be able to fully reverse the effects of sleep deprivation

But if the controlled media and education system keeps telling me that that Transgender is so ""Brave"", and you should be transgender as well because it's absolutely ""glorious"", it's pretty obviously ""speaking for the minority"" even if nobody likes hearing that shit. The media literally treats every LGBT as happy and consent and ignores the facts that they are not.

Don't forget there's probably huge amounts of taxpayer money involved to shove the LGBT propaganda to your face, and they know the majority of the people won't accept it and instead are perfectly against the agenda. They know children that are forced to transgender are probably suffering from their insane parents and education system. The only purpose of this is to create division against the populace, a distraction so the elites can go to war unstopped.

But who would have thought we would live to see the day a Donald Trump could kill off the 1960s?

That is exactly what has happened over the last ten days — Trump killed off the 1960s. Not the worst of it. The social horrors birthed in the ’60s; the fallout that never ends with drug abuse, the welfare state, and loveless sex will always be with us. You can never put evil back in the bottle.

The good things that came out of the ’60s — Trump killed almost all of that.

What have we learned over the last ten days?

Oh, only that the Obama administration launched a counter-intelligence operation against a rival presidential campaign complete with spies, wiretaps, unprecedented unmasking, media leaks, and FISA warrants based on lies.

None of that, however, is surprising. Government is corrupt, especially the federal government, most especially the unelected bureaucrats in the intelligence community. After living through Watergate, Iran-Contra, Billary selling the Lincoln bedroom, no WMD in Iraq, and Barry weaponizing the IRS and running guns into Mexico, I am well aware incompetence and corruption are the government’s default positions.

Introduced in Senate (03/23/2017)
Israel Anti-Boycott Act

This bill declares that Congress: (1) opposes the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution of March 24, 2016, which urges countries to pressure companies to divest from, or break contracts with, Israel; and (2) encourages full implementation of the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 through enhanced, governmentwide, coordinated U.S.-Israel scientific and technological cooperation in civilian areas.

The bill amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to declare that it shall be U.S. policy to oppose:

requests by foreign countries to impose restrictive practices or boycotts against other countries friendly to the United States or against U.S. persons; and
restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by an international governmental organization, or requests to impose such practices or boycotts, against Israel.
The bill prohibits any U.S. person engaged interstate or foreign commerce from supporting:

any request by a foreign country to impose any boycott against a country that is friendly to the United States and that is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation, or
any boycott fostered or imposed by any international governmental organization against Israel or any request by any international governmental organization to impose such a boycott.
The bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to include as a reason for the Export-Import Bank to deny credit applications for the export of goods and services between the United States and foreign countries, opposition to policies and actions that are politically motivated and are intended to penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with citizens or residents of Israel, entities organized under the laws of Israel, or the government of Israel.

299,Pizzagate is a false flag to cover up for the real pedo ring,"[Here is a picture of convicted pedophile George Nader with President Donald Trump](https://goo.gl/images/Nsddrz).  Do you know how much Trump got paid for this picture?  [$189,000](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/convicted-paedophile-george-nader-got-photo-with-donald-trump-for-189000-donation-a3846426.html).  Why so much money?  Because Trump himself is a diddler and is involved with a global pedo ring the likes of which we've never seen.  And why would he take the picture with **CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER** George Nader?  So that all the other pedos will see the picture and know who to contact to solicit sex from little kids.  The evidence is clearly there.  And they thought we were sheep who would follow their FAKE bread crumbs.  It's pretty obvious in hindsight.  Why else would Trump hang out with a creep like Stephen Miller?  Have you seen the guy?  He looks like the creepy math teacher who looks down his female students shirts.  And this whole so called Russian investigation is actually an investigation into a deep state pedo ring headed by Trump.  This deep state worked to get Trump elected so that they could have one of their own pedos in charge.  Why do you think Trump attacks the Washington Post so much?  Because they are preparing a story to out his allegiance to this secret pedo ring and he wants to discredit them so all his sheep won't believe it.  And why do you think he pulled out of the North Korea summit?  It's because China found out about it and told Kim Jung Un about it and he threatened Trump with it.  Trump was running scared.  Why else would he pull out of something that would guarantee him a Nobel Peace Prize?  And remember how Stormy Daniels said someone threatened her daughter?  That was someone trying to stop knowledge from getting out because Stormy knew about it.  It all makes sense.  All the pieces are fitting into the puzzle.

307,OKC Shooter's Youtube Channel and Weird Comments before Shooting on Latest Video,"Somebody linked me to the Lake Hefner shooter's youtube page and I've been going down a rabbit hole every since watching the weirdest videos and reading some of the strangest conversations in the comments. This is the original video that got me started:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohwn7rNIaPg&amp;feature=youtu.be

There is CLEARLY something wrong with this guy. He talks about being under demonic attack and how he needs to meet real people. If you read the comments on the video it gets even weirder.

We have an exchange between him and a female youtuber named Wild Style about two weeks ago:

**Wild Style:** Just keep sharing your experiences, we can prey for you. I want to hear more please. I love this stuff. Maybe can help. 💚💚💚💚🌈🐰🤷‍♀️✌️﻿
**Shooter:** thanks appreciate it, where are u from? well im pretty isolated, wouldn't mind moving in with someone, cant stand living alone, im going nuts with all this demonic attack against me.﻿

So he just wants to move in with some random lady commenter on a youtube video? And her typo (is it?) with the word “prey” instead of “pray” is pretty damn weird. 

Later this exchange happens:

**Wild Style:** Just subscribed 👍🙏🙏🦋😘💋 good stuff!  Will share comments with you too in surpport.﻿
**Shooter:** appreciate it, your channel is very interesting.﻿
**Wild Style:** I see you subscribed to my enemies. So I take that back. Don't know what games you think you are playing. But karma is a bitch.

What the hell right? What an odd exchange for two people who just met each other. Look at how many weird ass videos this guy has on his page:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDYWxRa6pGAq-al2R4GEOAw/videos

So then I clicked on her channel (Wild Style), which is full of weird videos about satan, the NWO, veganism, urine therapy and other weird stuff. Here is the main page:

310,Sweden about to man up vs Russia?,"I'm a swede and this is just my theory, it's not fact or anything like that. 

Reasons why i think Sweden will start a war:

1. Sweden is very anti-russian, especially since russia has several times ""invaded"" Sweden and recently they had a bomb drill against two Swedish targets.
(The article is in Swedish) https://www.svt.se/nyheter/amne/Ryssland%20övade%20anfall%20mot%20Sverige

2. Sweden has stated they are releasing their ""om kriget kommer""/""if the war comes"" pamphlet (which is about war, terrorism, crisis etc not only war) they stopped releasing it 1991 when the cold war ended which might be an indication about the Swedish future.

3. Sweden has raised their military's budget and announced several new high-tec inventions, especially the new ""Hit &amp; Run"" Archer which is a very good weapon system for the Swedish terrain. 

My theory: I think Sweden will either openly denounce russia very soon, or join NATO which is very bad in the Sweden-Russia relationship. Russia is practising close to Swedens borders &amp; flying over Sweden, i think Sweden will soon demand they stop or they will be met with force. 

Sweden knows we have 0% chance of winning vs Russia but we can make it very costly for Russia for invading Sweden if it were to happen. Sweden has openly said &amp; informed the citizens that if we were to be invaded our strategy would be to Hit &amp; Run when ever we can(ARCHER). 

The Sweden-Russian relationship is at an alltime low and i think Sweden wants to show Russia that we are willing to protect our country if they continue coming into sweden with planes/subs.

I don't really think Sweden will start a war or that they dare to threaten Russia but i do think our government wants to do something and is prepared to go to war if things go south. 

Since the pamphlet ""if the war comes"" ended in 1991 and is coming back now i'm pretty sure the government is prepared for something big.

Before someone says ""but the pamphlet is about war, weather disaster, it attacks, terrorism &amp; crisis not war only!"" Yes, it is. However i doubt they would go back to the ""if the war comes"" if it wasn't for something major, like a war. Otherwise they would've brought it back after Gudrun, swedens worst storm 10 years ago.",conspiracy,1527285130,Mika_Box,27,9,True,2018-05-25

330,The Irish referendum repealing the amendment was rigged.,"Ireland’s Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO), has ordered left-wing organization Amnesty International to return a donation of more than $162,000 from Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF). The donation is in violation of the 1997 Electoral Act, which bars foreign organizations from giving donations of more than $100 for “political purposes,” according to SIPO.

Amnesty has refused to return the donation, a defiant decision that OSF is supporting, British newspaper The Times reported on Wednesday. Amnesty has claimed that the law is unfair.

An OSF spokesman told The Times the group is “proud to be one of the sources of support for local advocacy efforts to bring Ireland’s abortion law in line with its commitments under international human rights law.”

Irish pro-life groups have decried Soros’ interference into their politics.

“It is important to recall that the Open Society Foundation stated when giving the money to Amnesty that it was to assist the coordination of groups in Ireland with a view to repealing the 8th Amendment and taking away legal protection for the baby in the womb,” Cora Sherlock, a spokeswoman for the Irish Pro Life Campaign, told the Catholic Herald.

“The involvement of this US based organization in the Irish abortion debate represents a gross interference in our democracy and in safeguarding the right to life. Amnesty should immediately return the money and stop trying to portray itself as a victim in all of this,” Sherlock said.

Soros, a Hungarian-American who once said he considers himself“some kind of god,” has previously sparked controversy with his interference in other countries’ political processes.

Soros uses a network of nonprofits and partner organizations across Europe to try and affect the outcomes of elections in foreign countries, leaked documents show. (RELATED: Leaked Docs Show How Soros Spends Big To Keep Populists Out Of Power In Europe)

Soros uses his billions of dollars to support candidates who favor his open-borders worldview and oppose populist candidates around the world.

As first reported by The Daily Caller, Soros secretly paid the salaries of Moldovan government officials, including the prime minister’s chief of staff, between 2013 and 2015. Those payments were funneled through a German non-profit in order to skirt laws preventing Soros from directly paying the officials. (RELATED: Soros Secretly Paid Foreign Government Officials)

The 87-year-old Soros transferred $18 billion to OSF in October, ensuring his organization will continue advancing his far-left worldview around the globe long after he passes away. Soros’ son, Alex Soros, has stepped up his own political activities in recent years as his father has gotten older. (RELATED: George Soros’ Son Dumps $100,000 Into California Ammo Control Efforts)",conspiracy,1527292666,Undercover5051,3,0,True,2018-05-25

The darkest hour.

Reddit is completely over taken and on its road to literally becoming a corporation.

This is monumental and we need all eyes on deck. 

The Reddit sub-Reddit communities are literally about to be sold out, right underneath all of our feed.

These new policy changes are truly disturbing. Please. Take a look yourself then I'll narrow it down as another user did.

Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018

First things first. I highly recommend you delete all old comments on any and everyone of your Reddit accounts. To do so, here's a complete guide

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/comments/8b5e3k/guide_how_to_delete_all_of_your_reddit_comments/

I have an old account I'm sure a few of you know of. I am in the process of mass-deleting my entire comments archive. I recommend you do too.

Now. Why do I sound so worried? Let's break it down as /u/911bodysnatchers322 did within /r/C_S_T so elegantly.

I mean who the hell reads TOS these days. Great catch, mate!

Here is the original thread that flagged my alarm bells

https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8m7j0x/why_im_finally_leaving_reddit_in_about_2_wks_or/

And with a thread at only 40 upvotes?! All of Reddit needs to know this. Fucking today.

Basically, as he already mentions, this is an intellectual property rights logistics nightmare. Not only that but they dance around the law like a snake trying to avoid stinging honey bees.

Alright let's get to the meat and potatoes 

Content Ownership Issue

It basically says:

&gt; We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms. Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to: a) license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content; b) modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or c) access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use.


It gets really scary... Corporation level scary.

Look at this shit

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:

When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

But wait. There's more. 

[3rd party content] We can spy on you in any way we want

[3rd party content] We can send you malicious javascript attack ads that have the potential to get you banned

[Things you can't do] If we arbitrarily decide to ban TRUEPUNDIT or DAILYCALLER because we capriciously (wrongfully) deem it to be hate speech and/or inappropriate and/or fake news and/or malicious javascript attack ad site (you know, like 'us', hee!), ((or just straight up the truth which is that we don't like it politically)) and you post that OR post the archive version of it, we can ban you.

We can use your username for our own content (ie: we can gaslight and appropriate your username 'likeness'),

We can use AI + NLP to copy your style

We can give your content to whomever we want for whatever reason

We can capriciously cancel your account for any reason

We can sell accounts (""You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.""). This one is tricky, you have to read between the lines. ""without our prior written approval""--this means they can be PAID to approve people to sell accounts, if they can do ONE, they can do THOUSANDS, so people can AI botnet and karma whore and then sell accounts to Fort Meade.

We can create and allow bot accounts for our corporate overlords (see above)

We can even hijack video content as ours, even if its from google -- so we can launder IP this way (that's how I read it but I'm not a lawyer)

If you use reddit at work, your company is liable for any actions you take on reddit

""Your license does not include the right to: license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;"" -- I read this as ""it doesn't give you a right, because that's what COPYRIGHTS are for""-- I wouldn't worry about this as much as I initially did


Looks like the corporate overlords are pulling out one last measure.

We can't let them win this time, and they won't!

I am prepared to do this. I've already deleted (well still am) old comments off my old account (so it can't be sold or used or used against me or get me banned or in trouble with a future job or whatever)

Do you guys see the scope of this problem?

Please. If you don't believe me just read the god damn TOS yourself



Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018

Guys this is seriously, seriously, a huge attack on individual freedom and property rights.

They won't win and they can't win and we won't let them win.

MODS &amp; USERS of conspiracy! I have infrastructure setup for a migration if we need to do it. I've already setup a necessary off site forum ages ago for personal archiving and sharing. No financial motive, I don't even take donations.

I'm not going to post a link without mod approval but if this is the kind of reality Reddit corporate overlords want to try to pull over us, then I'm going to be gone. And I recommend we all be gone too because all that will be left is corporate shills and AI's and bots (all using your information and writing flow/technique by the way)

This is dirty dirty stuff.

428,The Hidden Mars' Conspiracy,"In 1945 an American astronomer, B.P. Sharpless, issued a finding that Phobos, the larger moon of Mars, was slowly falling out of orbit and in 10\-20 million years it eventually would impact the planet. That is a long time in human time, but in cosmic time, it is but a mere second. His findings were met with much skepticism but eventually proved to be basically correct and stand to this day.

In 1966 I.S. Shklovskii, a respected Russian scientist, and Carl Sagan collaborated on a monumental book entitled Intelligent Life in the Universe. In the book Shklovskii recounts his 1959 determinations that Phobos had a “low density.” He wrote: “Could Phobos be indeed rigid, on the outside—but hollow on the inside? A natural satellite cannot be a hollow object. Therefore we are led to the possibility that Phobos and possibly Deimos as well—may be artificial satellites of Mars.”

The younger Sagan added a further view in that book to Shklovskii’s words: “Conceivably, the capture and hollowing of a small asteroid may be technically more feasible than the construction in orbit of an artificial satellite with material brought from the surface.

That early determination of hollowness about Phobos made in 1959 is little known today. Most writings of the voids in Phobos refer to the lower\-\-than\-expected\-\-mass findings \(comparatively large voids\) as coming from innocent and surprising probe measurements made far more recently. That is true about the eventual confirmation by on\-the\-scene probes, but initially that fact was suspected and calculations discussed back in 1959. One would think that data would have been a very good reason to target Phobos for an intense investigation as the future missions to Mars were being planned. Maybe it was the chief reason for the double Viking missions in the late 1970's. We are left to wonder if we were lied to about the real reason for those missions.

But that is not all that made the moon a suspect of being intelligently manipulated. The suspicious data was widely known. Its orbit and that of Deimos are directly over the equatorial area of Mars, and both, especially Phobos, orbits very close to the planet. Finally, because of the small size of Mars, astrophysics cannot properly allow how it could have captured not just one but two wayward asteroids and have them eventually develop almost perfectly circular orbits so close to the planet. By any measure, Phobos should have been a prime suspect in a different “search for life” experiment than the one touted as the reason for the missions, that of digging into the Martian dirt for signs of life. It is hard to believe that the outspoken Sagan didn’t point out those discrepancies of the moons from the norm as the missions were being planned. Surely, he would point out the logic of how the confirmation of the intelligent manipulation of asteroidal bodies around the planet would make digging in the Martian soil irrelevant. And probably, Sagan, being Sagan made that point and he was told to not blow the cover for the mission.

Another point never mentioned but as important and indicative as any of the rest in this saga is that Deimos, the more outer companion of Phobos is itself positioned at a not far distance that is only very slightly out of a synchronous orbit with the planet. While Phobos is slowly falling into the planet, Deimos is slowly falling away. That can only mean that at one time millions of years ago that it was in lockstep with the rotation of Mars, just as we learned to do with our communication satellites in the 1960's.

Allowing for the existence of ancient space\-capable civilizations answers most of the things we find puzzling today about Mars. But if we can’t use our intelligence to recognize UFOs for what they seem to be, why should we look beyond what we are told to accept and believe about Mars? Science and government had been fairly open in their quest to investigate the planets of Mars and Venus in general with the Mariner series of probes starting in 1962 their constantly improving data returns begin to send severe shocks throughout science. Mariner 9 returned surprising pictures of Mars and Phobos until October of 1972. Because of misleading earlier images from earlier Mariners, Mariner 9, the final one, showed evidence of vast amounts of erosion that could only be explained by once having surface water in abundance. Even little Phobos gave some interesting surprises of its own.

The Viking project was initiated in 1968 well before the shockingly clear images came down from Mariner 9. The project consisted of two identical missions sent a few months apart. They lifted off in the summer of 1975,.Each comprised of a lander and an orbiter. In each were thirteen investigations. The primary interest to the public if not the scientists was in the “search for life” experiments that would scoop up a bit of Martian soil and test it for signs of life and former life.

The Viking project was very ambitious and a remarkable success. Science would like to have you believe that it was a strictly basic, straightforward exercise in science. That would be true if there were not the bugaboo of flying saucers possibly lurking in every unknown corner of space.

Sagan, an extremely avid UFO believer as an undergraduate student, had by that time learned to hold such views in check and while enthusiastic about life elsewhere in the Universe, was a very out\-spoken critic of UFOs here at Earth. It was at his urging that the imaging of Phobos was included in the Mariner 9 schedule. As mentioned earlier, his interest in Phobos dates back at least to 1966. Later, as the Viking experiments were being planned he lobbied to get a lighting installed on the landers to capture any nocturnal creature activity during the Martian nights. But his request was denied due to weight limitations.

NASA and JPL may not have had strong inclinations to believe UFOs came from Mars, but evidence of water erosion found by Mariner 9 increased that possibility. What we know is that up to and including some of the results of the Viking missions the flow of data to the public was almost as quick as to the scientist.

This indicates that at that at the time of the beginning of the Viking missions no Mars’ conspiracy seemed to be at play. That then is a further indication that the Viking mission images of Phobos were an unexpected breakthrough that revealed too much and had to be concealed after the fact. How to do handle that belatedly? First, some official actions must be put into place, and second, a diversion to draw attention elsewhere. What we do know is that in 1992 NASA contracted with Michael Malin, formerly of JPL. Evidently with contacts within the agencies involved, he created his own company which was given exclusive rights over imaging and management of all photographs taken by the Mars Observer probe, the follow up to the Viking mission.. His contract allowed him to release or withhold images as he saw fit.

\(We must wonder if Sagan was quickly aware of what the Phobos images revealed, highly excited about the discovery, but subsequently crushed when the secrecy descended across the field and prevented him and his fellow scientists from working with that historical knowledge.\)

Most people remember the hullabaloo made over the supposed “Face on Mars” and supposed pyramids at Cydonia. They were a magnet to those interested in the strange aspects of the Viking images Mars. With a view in mind of a Mars’ conspiracy, we should wonder, was it a sham show, a misdirection ploy beaten into a froth by a center\-stage character to draw interest away from the more revealing data from the Vikings? \(I was there, an avid /Mars/UFOer, and I couldn’t understand the amount of hype.\) It was a clamorous, long, loud and detailed affair that went into ridiculous extremes of supposed data and arguments.

The “search for life” experiments showed some promise, but the results was not as expected and therefore deemed inconclusive by TPTB. That finding is still challenged by Gilbert Levin the designer of the module. As far as the public was concerned the negative finding virtually ended any popular concepts about Martians living or long dead.

What we do know is that in 1992 NASA contracted with Michael Malin, formerly of JPL and evidently with contacts within the agencies involved, he created his own company which was given exclusive rights over imaging and management of all photographs taken by the Mars Observer probe, the follow up to the Viking mission. His contract allowed him to release or withhold images as he personally saw fit. Gone were the days when Sagan and associates would stand by the printer impatiently waiting for it to download images directly to them and eventually into the public’s hands.

But the lack of due diligence had done its damage. The twin Viking orbiters had taken thousands of images of Phobos from all positions around the tiny moon, and they were released without NASA or JPL being aware of what they revealed. ",conspiracy,1527343481,Harvision,118,220,True,2018-05-26

The Fat Lady Sang - Robert Evans 
&gt;""My association with the Kennedy family continued through a close friendship with Teddy Kennedy""

spouse Catherine Oxenberg
(m. 1998; annulled 1998)

Princess Elizabeth was briefly married to a close family friend of the Kennedy's. Robert Evans. He details his continued relations in his memoir The Fat Lady Sang.

&gt;Princess Elizabeth recognized early the dangerous signs that would turn the former Yugoslavia upside down in a bloodbath of historic religious and ethnic rivalries long suppressed by Communist rule. She spoke out in Europe and America on behalf of bridging the gap between ethnic hatreds. Working behind the scenes through United Nations programs, she also journeyed to the Vatican in 1989 to ask Monsignor Tauran, then Holy See Secretary for Relations with States, to help improve relations between Catholic and Orthodox communities in Yugoslavia.[6]

&gt;At the end of 1990, she created the Princess Elizabeth Foundation, a non-political, not-for-profit organization after foreseeing the crucial importance of a vehicle to address the tension brewing just below the surface. Since the subsequent civil wars, her efforts have focused heavily on transporting medical supplies, food, clothing and blankets to refugee camps, in addition to finding homes for children victimized by war and placing older students in schools and colleges in America.[7]

&gt;Before the breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991, she invited the Orthodox Bishop Sava and the Mufti of Belgrade, along with the Yugoslav Minister for Religious Affairs to attend a conference in Moscow that was hosted by Mikhail Gorbachev.[citation needed] This was the second international gathering of political and religious leaders committed to world reform that included Mother Teresa, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dalai Lama, Al Gore and Carl Sagan.[8]

The US is literally being coaxed with the exact same tactics by the same people. Again, Obama and Hillary's ""5 Countries Toppled by Democracy"" trip starts this all, then now, Donald Trump. This man believes that he is the god of the world and; 

* Claims Jerusalem as the Israeli Capital (An act of insanity that basically shows who he actually serves. A surefire way to wage war with the middle east)
* Attacks Iran with a brazen treaty that sums up as destroying Iran similar to Japan's Treaty 21 to China. (Which sums up as destroying China's Economy and giving it to Japan.) 
* Continues to wage war against Syria using ISIS proxies (Which is in a way similar to Hanjian Espionage held by Japan against China)
* Continues to monopolize the Middle East under the orders of Israel, as if he was the untouchable god of that place (Like Japan trying to monopolize Asia)
* And now he's even trying to wage war against China and North Korea too, Trade wars aren't just trade wars, and America is literally unprepared against a war with 3 communist superpowers (When is similar to Japan overstretching to the east)

Remember, the place for China, Korea and the Southeast Asia as dead horses has been shifted to Iran, Syria, Libya and the like. Since they can no longer exploit the far east, they are now exploiting the middle east and africa.

So what happens to America when world war iii actually starts? The humlliation, destruction and the wake up slap just like how Japan faced in world war ii. Soon, world war iii will expose all of America's weaknesses upon the world and America and all of its allies will be taken down by Russia, China and North Korea. Once it's down, nobody will protect Japan, South Korea, The EU or any other country that America has pretended to protect. As for Israel, like Henry Kissinger said: ""there will be no more Israel in 10 years"" but the people behind the strings are still there.

Another country that fell into the prodding trap and forced into incompetency.

477,"Ancient Magic, Science, Psychology, and the Honorable Mention of Fractals","Hello I’m 21, atheist, and a high school drop out who has an opioid addicted mother and a murdered father. 
When I failed the tenth grade I was a little stupid shit. I took acid and mushrooms a lot and one time it did a thing to me. While all my friends were goofing off on the drug I was sitting there thinking about how actually stupid my friends and I were and how we didn’t know the words to describe how we were feeling and how the and the religions government didn’t care if everyone was stupid as long as the worked. Around that time and old homeless man showed me what fractals are I don’t remember what he said to me but ever since that day I’ve had some weird form of Synthesia where I can see information a giant bulk fractal all interconnected. I was then absorbing knowledge like Sherlock Holmes. I quickly realized it was a mistake to drop out of school. I attempted to go to college but my mom said I had to sign up for the military to get a scholarship (which I later found out wasn’t true) so that plan flopped. But I discovered the great courses and plus there’s a plethora of reputable scientific sources on the interwebs. So I began my studies of geology, biology, physics, psychology, quantum physics, astronomy, chemistry, and geology basically anything and everything. Then I realized there was no one I could talk to anymore because no one understood how any of that stuff worked except the homeless man so everyday I’d buy a gram of weed to go smoke with this homeless man so I could at least talk to someone about this stuff in me head. Through my conversations I realized even his scientific knowledge had limits due to the fact that he was trying to blend gnostic christianity and science and astrology. He would get angry when I questioned his loose ends and defensively brag to me his whole life story again and again so I quit hanging out with him so much. 

But then I realized it was my lack of knowledge of religions that was holding me back from being able to communicate with most Americans. This was also when I first started watching ancient aliens (Which I think is bullshit with some hint hints in there). But through the ancient alien theory I learned about so many cultures and religions and began to me own theory of civilization. But just to make sure I began to study the occult from alchemy, to Solomons’s magic to theosophy. Then I realized all of the history and magic I learned was all one sided. It was biased toward western theology so I felt like I had to balance it with eastern religions so I studied Buddhism, and Hinduism and the cultures around them. Then something clicked. The truth in the western world had been hidden through a massive game of telephone that is taken thousands of years and run through several secret societies degrading and dumbing down the knowledge whereas in the east it right there in front of your face just hidden amongst the chaos thousands of gods and of billions of people. The eastern religions do not conflict with science as much for this reason.  I now believe that these religions were ancient systems for scientific understanding that was given to us by gods or aliens or an ancient advanced race of people(maybe giants or the nephilim) but when the flood happened it got into bad hands and in the West it was hidden by the elites and kept hidden until Science came along in the Western world and was basically backwards engineering the ancient truth of the universe outside of what the western religions had become (thanks Roman empire). But in the east they took a more communal effort to sustain the truth and that is why when science came along they blended rather swimmingly

But what is a religion or a government? In a since they determine your whole life’s path through space and time. This is were ancient magic (a genius form of advanced psychology) comes into play. Carl Sagan said once that the human brain has leftover parts from evolution. The reptilian brain, Which controls aggression, territoriality, sexual behavior, social hierarchy and so forth. Then we have the mammalian brain on top of that which deals with emotions. Mammalian brain was developed after the extinction of the dinosaurs when young mammals needed to hang around their parents longer to learn how to develop in this new environment after the meteor hit. So evolution created a natural drive (emotions) that allowed for this. Lastly we have The gray matter on top. This is what I think, was what god or aliens or evolution did to us to make us conscious observers. This is what gives us the ability to know facts and be logical (left brain) and be creative and intuitive (right brain). 

Now think about how Society has people rigged up. They got males hardwired with the left brain and the reptilian complex and they’ve got women hardwired with the right brain and mammalian complex. When the obvious answer for how to get the most out of your brain is to use all of it equally but this is not what we’re taught by religion and government. 

Ancient Magic like spells and incantations to make a specific event happen in space and time can used by an individual to help something in their own life happen. Like science, spells require a series of factors lined up to create a specific event in space and time. By reciting the incantation you’re getting your self into the state of mine needed to do what you want to do. This can also be done to an entire nation of people hence propaganda religion and government. Hint hint. 

Part of the whole truth of the fractal bulk is that All of us are in control of our own evolution on an individual level and only we can determine what parts of our brains we will use in our lives and don’t let others trick you into believing their way of using your brain is “the true way”. Another tip in this day and age is that all the propaganda you see on the news kind of likes to appeal to your emotional and reptilian brain not the cerebral cortex. If you focus on the facts and the truth and don’t factor in your own mammalian and reptilian responses. It’s like separating the curds from the whey. 

I’m sorry if this contains grammatical errors (I used text to speech) and seems rushed or fragmented but this is only my first time trying to type this all out and I always have a lot to say on these topics. I’ve just gotten used to people not wanting to hear what I have to say so I usually just rush through topics so that I can quickly zoom out and hope that people see the larger connections that are connected to the bulk of everything that we experience. Feel free to ask me any questions or anything. I plan on starting mystery school an hour outside of Nashville in the near future to help people seek balance with their minds and increase mental fortitude and decrease their mental turpitude.

I believe this program is comprised of a dictionary list of all the word with an accompanying point system. So for instance if you post/upvote something with the word ""Beretta"" then they would assign you a high point rate, because they know that specific word would only be used by the gun owning population. These points are then added together to give a complex model of the users personality. This information can then be used for a variety of purposes. You can package it up and resell, use for espionage, sell to insurance companies so they know exactly what to charge, etc. People think that just because they create an anonymous handle on reddit that they don't know who you are when it clearly states in the privacy policy that they retain records of the ip address used to create the account.

486,Gaddafi's Green Book and American Lies.,"For those that don't know, one of the biggest things Gaddafi spent his time doing was promoting ""The Green Book"", a book he authored on the flaws of current democracy and how a true democracy of the people can be achieved. Libyan children spend two hours each week studying the book as part of their curriculum. Passages from the book were broadcast on TV and radio every day, and put up on billboards. 
The entire book is on how to achieve a true democracy even when the country consists of different tribes with very different views and lifestyles. Part of the book states ""Freedom of expression is the natural right of every person, even if they choose to behave irrationally, to express his or her insanity."" and that freedom of speech is based upon public ownership of book publishers, newspapers, television, and radio stations.

So we were lead to believe that Gaddafi is an evil dictator who brutalized his people in order to stay in power and keep all of Libya's resources for himself. What kind of dictator makes it part of the class curriculum to read his own book on freedom and democracy. And constantly distributes copies of a book on true democracy, and spreads those ideas through TV and radio? 

Libya would have truly been the gem of Africa had he created a gold backed currency like he wanted. Spent 30 billion on the largest water distribution project to turn the entire country green and be agriculturally self sufficient. Gave 500 million to put a satellite in space for all African countries to share and use for free.

494,Conspiracy to kill Kim Jong Un?,"Not sure if this qualifies as a true conspiracy (yet). Trump's appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor was probably the biggest factor. As many know, Bolton is a tremendous hawk believing the only way to deal with North Korea is with pre-emptive strikes. 

On May 1, Trump agreed to meet with Kim Jong Un at the DMZ between the two Koreas. On May 24, in order to demonstrate to the world that North Korea was serious about their ambitions to create peace, Un destroyed their nuclear research facility Punggye-ri.

On the very same day, Trump announced the summit meeting with Kim Jong Un had been scrapped. He said:
 
""Our military, which is by far the most powerful anywhere in the world that has been greatly enhanced recently as we all know, is ready as necessary.""

""If and when Kim Jong Un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting,"" he said.

The message from the White House made no sense at all given what had just happened in North Korea. You would have thought Kim Jong Un had just bombed Tokyo.

There's nothing Kim Jong Un could have done more to create a better situation for a peaceful summit. Why is our administration being so hawkish, distrustful, and aggressive towards the North Koreans? 

To my eyes, it looks to me as if Kim Jong Un has a target on his back, not that there ever wasn't a target on his back, but it looks like there's nothing he can do to get rid of it. To my mind, this reeks of a conspiracy. It's the destruction of a man, a country, without just cause and without transparency.

16,Airline MH370 disappearance: New theory,"In light of the US government's tech ban on Chinese technological giant ZTE, although still in initial stages, could give a reason to the cause of the MH370 disappearance. 

Context: Recently the US government imposed a tech ban on technological giant ZTE where it has been exposed that the Chinese government-run company is heavily reliant on western technology. This was discovered through the company halting all operations the days after the ban was imposed. It turns out that China was missing what you refer to as ""core technology"" in developing their products such as smartphones. Some of these ""core technology"" included semiconductors and microchips that China has yet to develop. The first case happened in 2012 when the FBI launched an investigation on ZTE and found out that they have been selling banned technology to Iran despite the US's sanctions on Iran... which brings us to 2014 when the MH370 went missing. Coincidentally, on the flight, there were 20 staff members heading to Beijing that worked for the US technological company ""Freescale Semiconductor"" which develops powerful microchips for industries such as defense... According to the loose facts right now, it seems as if someone was trying to stop the 20 scientists going to Beijing with vital information on microchips from getting there.

The timeline goes:
July 14th, 2012: US Federal Bureau investigations find that ZTE has been selling US technology to Iran despite the US sanction on Iran
March 8th, 2014: MH370 goes missing bringing along 20 staff members that work for ""Freescale Semiconductor"" which develops powerful microchips

I was always interested in the truth and finding out how the world works, so I have an open mind to anything alternative. I'd like to share my knowledge of my research thus far, I won't detail it, just a short description of my findings so far.

&amp;nbsp;


# 1) UFO/Aliens

I don't think aliens have visited us, and even if they did in the past they probably have cloaking tech so they didn't interacted with us, would have no reason to. Either way no alien contact. Crop circles are hoaxes, alien abduction stories are just sensationalism, people wanted 10 minutes of fame, and the gray creatures are either CGI or dolls put in there. The UFO's a probably secret military technology, people in the 50's were sighting triangular shaped black planes, and in the 70's the stealth planes came out so it was just military testings ahead of time. This shows that military tech is probably 20-30 years more advanced than advertized, but no aliens there. There is more but you should do your own research. As for the myriad of ""alien"" videos on Youtube, those are just some jerks playing with video animation software.

&amp;nbsp;


# 2) Chemtrails

I think they are real. Plane fuel didn't changed since the 70's yet the number of white linear long clouds are now above every major city. Contrails dissapear almost instantly, chemtrails persist for many hours. Interestingly chemtrails only happen in North America and Europe, not in China or Russia, despite the same climate, so it's obvious that something is not okay there, and it's done by the US-EU elite. Even Wikipedia admits there could be [Stratoshoperic Aerosol Injection going on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection_(climate_engineering)), from balloons, well from planes it would be more efficient. 


&amp;nbsp;


# 3) Moon Landing

An obvious hoax, I have given some hints here:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8e3f1u/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_the_moon/dxu064s/

&amp;nbsp;


# 4) Space Travel / ISS / Satellites

While at it I think space travel is also a hoax. I don't just think that men never were to the Moon, I also think men never even went to space, nor did launch anything there that stayed there. I think satellites don't exist, you don't need them, the [Skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave) phenomena is just like if you had satellites, but without them. Simply put, everything launched up there just comes back and falls into the ocean. I don't think we have the technology to launch up anything there. Most spaceships look like jokes. 

Of course the ISS is also a hoax, all of their live footages is just so obvious CGI that loops after a few hours since probably the animation crew is on low budget, and their permed hairs and showing harnesses when they float is just so obvious. It's probably recorded in an underwater pool (remember some footages show bubbles in space), and in  [reduced gravity aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft) which can only have small gravity for a limited time, that is why they only show the ""astronauts"" for a short time and then switch the picture, you won't see a video where there is a continuous 30 minute footage of these astronauts floating.

Also if you wonder about the ""telescopes"", all of them are on Earth Observatories. The Hubble Telescope doesn't exist, it's basically just a camera on a plane called [SOFIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Observatory_for_Infrared_Astronomy).

Simply put there is no man made space travel, all of it is a lie.

Not to mention a lot of Nazi scientists were behind the ""space program"". It's probably just a Nazi lie.


&amp;nbsp;


# 5) Shape of the Earth

I am not a Flat Earther before anyone would accuse me of so. I do believe in the ball earth, though I am skeptical about the Newtonian model. I don't think the calculations are entirely correct, or accurate. Something is probably missing and it's the reason why we can't go to space. Though the ball shape of the earth can be easily demonstrated with basic tools, anyone can test it, so it's not up for debate.

The Flat Earth movement on the other hand is a psyop, made to discredit skeptics, especally space travel skeptics and moon landing skeptics and put them in 1 crazy category to make them look like crazy people.

&amp;nbsp;



# 6) General Physics

Well I haven't looked into all aspects but I am pretty sure the Newtonian model is not entirely correct. Nor the Cavendish Experiment which is an obvious joke. I am also not sure about General Relativity. I think Einstein did bring up a lot of interesting models and innovations, but I don't think his model is entirely accurate, or at least wrongly interpreted. Quantum Physics is probably more correct and verifiable, though that has opened up new doors. The truth is probably somewhere in between, but tilted towards the Quantum phenomena.

I am also skeptical of the Big Bang, it is kind of like the theist answer, when you cant explain something you just insert an infinite redundancy there. The Big Bang theory naturally implies a Multiverse, so it doesn't explain anything it just steers away the explanation into something else. This is pretty illogical.

On the Tesla vs Edison feud I have to side with Edison. I know there are many Tesla fanboys now, but really I think alternating current is very inefficient, it may be better for longer distances but Edison's direct current approach would have had a more decentralized approach since you'd have needed shorter length cables and more nodes in the grid. I am Libertarian so I prefer the decentralized approach, also Edison wasn't as bad, a lot of Marxist are now smearing him, and worship Tesla like Jesus or something. Also  I think the ""secret hidden technologies "" of Tesla are just a myth, I don't think they ever existed. 

If there is any ""free energy"" then why are there no blueprints for that? Do you think the Government in the 1800's could have destroyed all evidence? Not a chance, it is more likely that it never existed.

&amp;nbsp;



# 7) Climate Change


I think it's a hoax and a scam. There is no evidence for it whatsoever, a lot of scientists were caught fabricating evidence. They haven't been able to find a consistent model in the past 50 years to explain things so it's pretty likely that their model has a lot of plotholes in it. The scientists are all in an echo chamber where they fire scientists who deny it, most of them in government payrolls and in privately funded NGO's.

On the sinister side of it, you see even the oil companies financing it. Now why would the oil business fund these climate change NGO's?

It's because of these carbon taxes, which would be like a 1.5 trillion $ revenue, that would be sent to them. The funny thing is that the oil industry is not against it, which means that the only victims here would be the average citizen who would have to pay an extra 2-5% tax  on products as if we are not taxed enough already?

The banks are in on it too, the carbon credit market opens up new ways for them to create new financial derivatives.

It's all a big scam, and you are the only victim of it.


&amp;nbsp;


# 8) Elite Nazi Cabal in the US

I think there is an active Nazi Cabal in the US, the ""Shadow Government"" which was made up of Nazis and their descendants. The US and even the UK has funded Hitler, mostly the US. People like Henry Ford and many others for example were part of this cabal, and were neck deep in Nazi affairs.

Now this Nazi Cabal was basically one of the most powerful elite factions in the 20's and 30's doing eugenics, experiments on blacks and all kinds of things. The oil industry, some banks and many business magnates were in on it. 

They directly funded the German Nazi party and supplied Hitler up until 1940 with materials and machine parts and fuel. They have even attempted a fascist coup during WW2, which was exposed by Smedley Butler:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot

After the war they have invited over most of their Nazi friends to the US as [Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_clip) and helped smuggle others to Argentina and other places. Rumors say Hitler and Mengele both lived in South America until their death.

They even helped reinstall many convicted Nazi warcriminals back into high european offices and bureaucracies. A lot of West Germany was run by ""ex-nazis"" for instance up until 1984.

The EU faction is well documented here:

* http://www.eu-facts.org/en/roots/index.html
* http://www.eu-facts.org/en/whoiswho/foundingfathers.html

And the US wing is also well documented elsewhere, I am not going to go into details but we all know who they were don't we.

Now if your parents were hard core Nazis, you bet they will indoctrinate their kids to carry on their legacy stealthy. Make no mistake about it, this cabal is still actve.

&amp;nbsp;


# 9) JFK Assasination

Well the JFK Assasination was perpetrated by this Nazi Cabal. JFK put his brother to investigate and expose these Nazis, as their actions go back way into the 20's so it was a lot of evidence to go through. Both JFK and Bobby Kennedy was assasinated, what does this tell you about it?

&amp;nbsp;


# 10) Syphilis &amp; Gas Experiments in US

There were [Syphilis experiments carried out on innocents and gas was released in many cities as tests against bio weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States). They have gassed many US citizens with bacteria, just like they gassed a lot of innocent people at Auschwitz. These were Nazi scientists continuing their dirty work.

They even used Gas Chambers in US prisons up until recently. I mean the Nazi Cabal had it's fingerprints all over the place.

&amp;nbsp;



# 11) 9/11

I think it was an operation carried out by this Nazi Cabal, it had all of their fingerprints on it. The towers were probably controlled demolition, athought the NIST report makes a pretty good case for the official story, so I am not sure. But the motive behind it is very clear. It was an exactly similar event like the [Reichstag Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire) and the [Reichstag Fire Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree) which was also done by the Nazis. The Patriot Act is extremely similar in both intent and results as the Fire Decree, it solidified the power of the Nazis.

I think a Nazi coup took place on 9/11, probably the ""Shadow Government"" behind the scenes tried to gain back their glory from the 20's after they had been more or less becoming suppressed so it was just like a JFK event, trying to gain back their power and they probably succeeded.

Now what was the result of it? Well increased police brutality, militarization of police, war, and decreased civil liberties. Doesn't it sound familiar.

And now you have Neo Nazis marching on the streets both in Europe and in the US, openly and shamelessly.

&amp;nbsp;


# 12) Big Pharma

There is no question about it, in Europe at least, most Pharma businesses are or are descendants of the Nazi businesses. I mean these people were operating [Auschwitz III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowitz_concentration_camp) for Christ sake, they forced poor Holocaust victims to create their own poison: they manufactures Zyklon-B with the camp prisoners, it is just a horrible past.

Most of the ""pills"" you take today were researched through human experimentations at Auschwitz, and [many convicted Nazi war criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_ter_Meer) were then hired back after the war. It's just disgusting.

Vaccines were basically created at Auschwitz as a method to poison off the inmates.

Chemo-Therapy was basically the codeword they used when they injected Holocaust victims with all kinds of experimental drugs, that is literally from where the term came from, they even used the word ""chemo therapy"" in the SS documents.

Fluoride was used as a nerve poison to make inmates docile and obedient and lower their cognitive capacity, studies prove it lowers the IQ by 10 points in children. 

Now they put Fluoride in drinking water, toothpaste and other stuff, it's obvious the Nazis are behind it.


&amp;nbsp;


# 13) Big Agro

The [Codex Alimentarius](https://www.infowars.com/the-history-of-health-tyranny-codex-alimentarius-part-1/), was created by Nazis. Most pesticides were also Nazi products, and those coming from the US eugenics factions. 

Pesciticides, chemicals in food, are all dosed in a way described by these Nazis, to make people get as much cancer as possible, it's a total Nazi plan.


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


# 14) The Financial System


This is the biggest conspiracy so I left it for the last. It is not even a question that big banks control the world, the question is who is behind the banks.

Now this sub has been very much infested by anti-semites recently, probably this Nazi Cabal sending out paid shills to derail the /r/conspiracy community.

However I have done a lot of research in it and found zero evidence for the ""Jews control all the banks"" claims. You know a masterful deception from the start, because there is never any tangible evidence behind it, but there is always overwhelming evidence against it, yet the perception of people is fooled to think that correlation is causation, well here it never is.

First of all most of these anti-semitic myths came from the Protocols of Zion, which is an obvious Black Propaganda book, probably written by Prussian Secret Police, I am not going to detail this, research it yourself.

Before that Anti-Semitism was mostly religious, like the Jewish Deicide, or completely delusional like claims that Jews caused the Black Plague. So before the Protocols, there was no ""Grand Jewish Conspiracy"", it was just local anti-semites hating on Jews because they didn't assimilate and didn't convert on Christianity.

Nobody before the 1900's claimed that Jews run finance, but history was rewritten since that, especially by Goebbels.

&amp;nbsp;


### What about the Jewish medieval lending?

Every anti-semite makes a big deal out of it, saying that the Church banned Catholic lending, and only Jews were allowed, therefore Jews became rich and controlled the world after this.

This is plainly false. In the Medieval times, Venice and the Venician Florins were the defacto reserve currency (before British Empire, France and Spain), and this banking model was the precursor to the current debt based monetary system. All major bankers and elites were Catholics.

There were a few banks that basically controlled all the finances in the entire Christian world, and they were all run by the Pope.

Jews were allowed to lend, but they were very poor ghettoized communities, so they certainly didn't got rich out of it, mostly giving loans to help out some poor people. Many pogroms and expulsions happened accompanied by total asset forfeiture so Jews didn't even had time to become rich, since they were always looted.

Most of the early conquests were probably funded by these banks, including the Columbus expedition. Basically the entire Spanish and Dutch expansion was funded by this. Allededly even the British expansion was funded by this but I am not sure.

So until the 1800's Jews didn't even had a stable rights to property let alone become rich bankers, so this claim is totally false.


&amp;nbsp;

### What about the enlightenment age?

The enlightenment age was dominated by protestant industrialists. By this time the Catholic banking influence decreased, but still no Jewish influence at all. The anti-semitism in the 1800's in the US was similar to that in Europe.


&amp;nbsp;

### What about the 20th century?

Jews by the early 20th century gathered enough money to become small artisants and craft workers, small business operators. By this time the law usually treated everyone equally. And as you see in the Weimar Republic for instance most Jews were: watchmakers, teachers, small shop owners, etc...

A few Jews became more succesful but not really members of the true Elite, mostly upper middle class actors and businessmen.

&amp;nbsp;

### What about the late 20th century?

Well after the Holocaust the Jewish wealth was basically wiped out in Europe, the Nazi Gold which contained most of the Jewish wealth is still missing. Barely any Jews left in Europe, let alone rich Jews. 

Most Jews went to Israel, where most of them live middle-class lifestyles but there are many poor Jews in Israel too, it's pretty hard to imagine any kind of conspiracy, when there are many poor people there too.

Some Jews became successful in the US, but this is probably 1970's onwards.


But to claim that they run the financial system is pretty absurd when you put it in context. Even if there are some Jewish bank clerks and stockbrokers that is basically nothing compared to the ""old wealth"" the ""old nobility"" that had their money for thousands of years before the Jews were even in Europe.

None of the real banking elite is Jewish, John Keynes the modern architect of the financial system was an anti-semite. Most Elite bankers in the 20th century funded Hitler, both the US and British side.

There are many Japanese, Korean and Chinese Bankers, are they all Jewish?

The BIS which is the supreme planetary central bank was always run by Catholics.


Simply put the Jews barely have any influence in finance, and are just put there to scapegoat people into antisemitism. The Jews were always innocent, there is no evidence that they have been involved in any conspiracy whatsoever.

English is not my first language so excuse me for any mistakes.

It's hard for me to talk about this. Because at the moment the things i was shown were definitely ""out of this world"". I reacted with violence I can't even write it down. I'm also afraid of telling because of skepticism. I can tell ""WE"" as a race are not prepared for certain ways of thinking.

I'll try to explain the concepts that i think this entities were trying for me to understand:

""Space and time as an illusion""

Grasping the idea that this ""clockwise"" world is merely a bond between nature and it's surroundings. We are of the earth and to her we do return. Nature is wise and WILL ALWAYS talk to us on her own ways. As humans we should likely take into account that we are the passengers. This big rock that's carrying us in space will also disappear.

""What's real? What's not?""

It's nearly impossible that there comes a day where ""aliens"" come to ""talk"" with the human race. As for they can also see what's going on here. There's much more of an observer point of view from them than a ""let's intervene"".

This is why communication is done at a personal level. It's easier to wake up a couple of persons than an entire country. And far less ""shocking"". We live in a VERY fearfull society and this is not something to overlook.

Would you land in your living body in a place like this? With all the risks that you KNOW exists? No, but i'll try to help from a safe distance. Or why not? A safe bodyless form.

Last thing. We love to think of more advanced civilizations in the universe. This certainly IS interesting. BUT what about us? We ARE an advance civilization. We have an incredible ammount technology (i wouldn't omit the idea that we got some external help), we have the capability to make ""heaven on earth"", we have the tools.

It's what we do with what we know. No other way around.

There are also many old spirits roaming the earth. To them is who i think we should listen. Our ancestors.

I'm sorry but i realized i've no idea how to put into words the actual sequence of events in english. I'm trying my best. It's ok, i wasn't looking for your acceptability. I just wanted to take this stuff out.

51,"Mouse ""melting pot"" study /mouse utopia","*A guy at my university working on his Phd is working on his thesis testing survivability of mice in different environments \(which I am proof\-reading for him\).  He allowed me to share this here to help him too if possible:*

I separated the mice into several environments as per the following:

1. Allowed unlimited breeding, and adequate food for the population \(even as it grew\). 

2. Allowed unlimited breeding, but kept food supply constant \(limited\).

3. Forced the mice to perform tasks to receive food.

4. Rewarded mice that showed signs of teamwork or sharing by allowing them to breed \(and killing off the ones that didn’t.\)

5. Rewarded mice that stole food from other mice by allowing them to breed \(and killing off the ones that didn’t. This was done with both limited food supply, as well as simple removal/euthanasia of non\-stealing mice.\)

After 5 years of being in their respective environments, I placed ALL the mice from all the environments into the \[expanded\] environment that required task completion to receive food.  I called this experiment “the melting pot”. Only the mice from group 3 were able to acquire food first\-hand. However, once they had food they were not able to eat because \~90&amp;#37; of the mice from group 5 immediately stole the food. Very few of the mice from group 3 fought back, and subsequently starved to death. Approximately 80&amp;#37; of the mice from 4 attempted to “share” in the food stolen by 5, but 5 did not share, and within 2 weeks 95&amp;#37; of group 4 had starved to death, with the remaining 5&amp;#37; becoming successful in stealing.  Approximately 92&amp;#37; of the mice from A starved, while 8&amp;#37; stole or attempted to steal from others that had gained food. 

Summary \(link to research paper to be posted upon MIT release; remember “A Study on Generational environmental learning in mice and group competition in an advanced environment” \):

In order of shortest to longest time to complete extinction: 3, 4, 1, 5, 2

The average mass of each group of mice at start of “melting pot” experiment was:

1\) 22.7

2\) 19.3

3\) 20.4

4\) 19.7

5\) 21.6

My observations/opinions, \(as I’m still writing the thesis and it will be mostly a presentation of data, and OMITTING opinion\) are that in that melting pot, the “most productive” died the most quickly because they didn’t have to survive based on competition with each other. Their survival was a competition with their own genes \(ability to finish task/use tool\). They rarely fought, and typically did a task to have access to food, as opposed to teamwork or stealing. The “mouse utopia” mice from group 4  \(which were second to go extinct\) showed more fright \(and much less “fight”\) than all the other mice when competition was encountered. Group 1 mice showed the most variation in the “melting pot” scenario, fighting, fleeing, stealing, etc, but they were the least healthy of all the mice in the experiment, although this aspect was not measured except in noting “natural causes” of death. Group 5 showed fierce competition to survival because there was no hesitation in trying to steal food.  

Group 2 survived the longest because they engaged in stealing and were also the most aggressive, often attacking other mice even without food involved. Group 2 mice would eat the tails and feat of dead mice. They were also the group that was most exposed to “closed environment natural selection”, meaning that I allowed more “natural” deaths in their original environment than artificial \(me killing them\). This experiment is on\-going, and will undergo some changes to allow for more time in the “melting pot” scenario, as this scenario did not last long due to how quickly the “skilled mice” were starved out.

**What future mice environments would be helpful to understanding scenarios that currently, or in the future face mankind?** \(Please note, your idea becomes public domain upon publishing here, and I may therefore very well include it in the “Future Work” portion of my paper; HOWEVER, it is even better for all of us/science if these studies are duplicated and performed by separate entities.\)",conspiracy,1524593998,timstolt78,9,7,True,2018-04-24
56,Let's talk about the possible split up of California,"Maybe this is a non-conspiracy, but r/conspiracy serves a unique role where it can take topics that can't fit in other places.

It's pretty clear that California is not going to stay as is too much longer. There's a proposal to split Cali into 3, Jefferson has been on the table for a while and there's a proposal for New California. California's also talked about leaving the US in the past.

A lot of sides have something to gain and lose here:

The US as a whole - It will be the first change in a long time, though prior to be 60 years ago, the US was constantly changing. Places like California weren't even part of the US for a lot of its existence as well as many other places. A split would maybe look weak to other countries and would be some loss of prestige, but would be a way to ensure more people could be more uniquely represented.

The right has a lot to gain. California has the most electoral college votes and them losing some or splitting some would be huge for us. Many R's in California don't feel represented and are tired of the high taxes and costs that they pay, yet don't see much in return for. A split or secession would also leave openings for similar splits, which would benefit us.

The left has some things to gain. They would have an even greater control in their sections. Depending on how the electoral college votes work out and how the split goes, it's possible they could gain some votes as well. This might even get them a step further into leaving the US, which would allow them full control over their land, but would also likely get them re-taken over by the US or someone else.

""Ok, so...

Short summary of major Powers that be:

Talmudic Zionists: think the non Jews are essentially cattle and need to be used as such. Large control center here...media, Hollywood, fiat currency, etc etc.

Illuminati cabal: 1700s Illuminati and what I would call, Mason's aligned with the black tiles so to speak, this includes people's in the Scottish and York rite that are generally up to no good. These guys mostly think that because they are of the 15&amp;#37; or so descending from the line of cain...those without rhesus DNA, the RH\- line....are to inherent the earth and everyone else is more or less a baby, there is a phrase, ""don't cast pearls before swine lest they trample them into the mud"" or something like that, but they are kept at arm's reach from the truth by essentially distractions based on hedonism and instant gratification...it's the serpent with the apple, the apple is a blindfold if you aren't careful, the blindfold is optionally permanent as they I'll continue to feed you and feed you. White hat masonry as it were...which to me is a different distinction, descended from ancient Egypt and Phoenicia etc, it is a collection of more or less gnostic teachings based on equality among sentient beings, both from this world and others, Thoths stuff etc, the DMT in the family acacia, the beating to death of the ego state by jubela, jubelo, and jubelum .... phonetically, what is this? Aaaauuuummmm. our tradition is mostly focused on leaving breadcrumbs out for the public, talking to people if we can, and engaging the engines of change within the social sphere, and now the infotechnosphere; it's akim to like protecting eggs or baby chickens or kittens or something. The teachings therein are similar to the Ra material...the trouble lies in that balance accepts a notion that to be closer to the one, we try to experience many possibilities and iterations aligned with what I might call a cosmic grey area. Example, I'll do work for both sides but the last thing I remember before walking up here was being bayonetted to death by maps troops as a Buddhist in what was Tibet....it's extremely disturbing, and I remember brothers I knew that are still alive today, but here now I feel as though Americans need everything they can get to clear the smoke and push through this great... unfolding/learning/awakening event.

Corporate feudal state: yea im not 100&amp;#37; sure who controls this, but my feeling is...some kind of virus, perhaps a parasite, perhaps some dickish non terrestrial group that shall not be named. Perhaps several. But it isn't great and it's aims are similar to the Talmudic Zionists.

The old Churches:. Aim to control mostly, believe humanity is essentially babies and that this will come slowly to fruition, the answers are literally in their texts...the pine cone statue in front of the Vatican and the fish hat denote a ton of information in and of themselves, ties all the way back to the Dogon and Sirius B. But none the less, it's control mostly, but slow unfolding also. Sometimes I wonder if the pope is really controlled by some unseen black pope we haven't heard of...I have good opinions of vedism and Buddhism but that's kind of another story, I don't know if we need monks these days as much as warrior\-monks...those aligned with knowledge but not opposed to acting.

A.i. \- I think this falls into corporate feudal state.

All in all the truth is: everything Humanity needs is out there, it's about assembling the pieces, every group puts out all of their knowledge and plans because they must as an appendant aspect of positive karma...we are all trying to get home and become whole again \- this is a fact. The alignment makes little difference once we understand that all is one. E pluribus unum \- out of many, one. Have you ever heard of manly Halls opinion on the secret and Destiny of America? It relates to the pyramids that used to be here...and what the Hopi know about the non terrestrials we have been aligned with for eons. Anyways, the trick here is to realize that if we aren't distracted and look into the right places, with eyes that see...we can find anything, and we can learn anything, and we can do anything. This place is the equivalent of an amazing video game pushed to difficult mode.

It is the functional equivalent of the original halo game on legendary for the first time. Or whatever popular analogy you prefer. Sorry if that was a ramble, but im hoping that helps and wasn't all just a repeat of the obvious. If not...good on you for having eyes that see.""",conspiracy,1524596049,bBAMEr,11,0,True,2018-04-24

66,Could my Chinese teacher possibly be a Chinese spy?,"Let me present my case. I take a highschool Chinese course. My class has very few people (less than 10) and everybody is very shy and quiet (even me). I thought my teacher was okay at first, but then they started acting weird. 

About halfway through first quarter, they started getting us to write about our families. Not just how many brothers and sisters we have, but the names of our parents, their ages, and where they work. I was thinking, okay, maybe they are a little personal. Not a big deal. It got a little more weird when they started to take time out of class to talk to us about how great China is and about how communism works in China. On top of that, they are often out of class or school. They also have a sub at least once a week. They never notify us when they'll be out or when they will come back. They have also taken two week-long trips to China so far this year. I spent most of the year thinking she was just unorganized. Then they told us about how they graduated from top a Chinese highschool with great grades. You'd think they'd be more organized, right. I finally got suspicious when they taught us to say military base and army. They said that we should use this knowledge to add to our ""All about me"" (more like all about my family) paragraphs. It finally connected in my head that they could be a spy. What do you guys think?",conspiracy,1524597436,connorheyz,15,10,True,2018-04-24

Why is this the subject of a ""conspiracy""?","Let's not forget how much Republicans and conservatives lie and slander to get their way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwpdgPMdMk 

My favorite part is the ""tax you at 90%"". Such lies from conservative capitalists with money. He really told these people Bernie is going to leave them with only 10% of their pay. I like to think conservatives aren't stupid, so I say they lie!

Had Democrats adopted the Bernie meme. Republicans would have branded them as socialist commie liberals coming to take your guns and tell you they are female. Uh.

Bernie was independent his entire political career until now. Democrats want to remain capitalist and somehow that's the big crime. I highly suspect real Trump supporters and shills use this strategy of virtue signaling constantly. Among lie because they will stop at nothing to win or change the culture instead of letting it evolve. 

Yeah there's a lot of socialists in the U.S.A. Lot of people don't even know how socialist/communist they really are. So maybe Bernie would have gotten the 100,000 votes between three states difference. He also might have lost the rural areas because we all know how American they are and how much they hate socialist commies the Republicans are against.

Yeah, I know the easy response is going to be, ""Well, they colluded with media"".

70,Here are 18 examples of the spectacularly wrong predictions made around 1970 when the “green holy day” (aka Earth Day) started:,"

1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”

2. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.

3. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”

4. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”

5. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”

6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”

7. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.

8. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”

9. In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”

10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”

11. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.

12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.

13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).

14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”

15. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.

16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”

17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”

18. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”",conspiracy,1524598855,SuperCharged2000,42,8,True,2018-04-24
78,Why the NHS needs people like Alfie Evans dead,"Provocative title .. sure .. but read with an open mind. I'm not a doctor and wont be making any determination of the merits of withdrawing care from this child, that's besides my point.

The Italian government has offered to continue treatment for Evans in light of the NHS's decision to withdraw care, there is absolutely no further obligation from the British NHS to Evans but the NHS has refused to allow the Evans family to travel to Italy with Alfie. This tells me the NHS believes there is some chance for Evans to recover. Naturally they don't want to pay for what may be a very small possibility but if he goes to Italy and improves they will have a PR fiasco on their hands. They are risking a great deal of credibility on this and have already lost some credibility as their prognosis of near immediate death after he was taken off his respirator hasn't taken place. Think about that for a minute: not only has the NHS stopped providing treatment, but they are actively preventing his parents form seeking treatment elsewhere. 

What other conclusion could you draw form this other than the NHS wants to see him dead to cover their own asses. ",conspiracy,1524601087,TheTrueLordHumungous,19,0,True,2018-04-24

179,An interesting metric on how closely the surveillance-state monitors Reddit,"On 4/21 at 4:08pm pacific-time I posted this on r/books:

www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8dzdbb/the_bestseller_thats_not_for_sale_how_censorship

about a fake publisher (Tayen Lane) created to keep a book off the US market. The post covered (among other things) how the offices of Tayen Lane don't exist.

At 4:53pm that same afternoon, Tayen Lane's website disappeared, as first reported here: 

www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8dzdbb/the_bestseller_thats_not_for_sale_how_censorship/dxr75ki/

That's 45 minutes from Reddit-post to website gone. 

Not bad.

It's worth noting that www.tayenlane.com had been up since September 2014. 

Their website is still cached by google btw, and I recommend visiting so you can get a taste of what a fake publishing front looks like. 

The reaction to the post was also interesting.

It took them almost 10 hours to mount an effective discrediting-campaign, but it finally arrived at 1:30am (pacific), and for the next 4 hours they dropped the post from 87% upvoted to 69%, and got pretty much all the top comments. Interesting that this big shift happened during the early/pre-dawn hours of a Sunday morning in the US. I guess 'they' never sleep.
 
Not surprisingly, their tactics included the old ""distract from the real topic"" (censorship) and ""shoot the messenger"". 
This had the comical result that I was branded both a kremlin-bot AND a nazi. A pretty wide spectrum they cover there... but I doubt consistency is their thing. They just hurl whatever crap they manage to squeeze out at that moment.

As bad as that was, it was nothing compared to the vile treatment they have given the late Prof Udo Ulfkotte (the book's author). It's a disgrace what they have done to his memory and his wiki-page, and his work, now that he isn't around to defend himself anymore. May he rest in peace.

 citing this [RT article.](https://www.rt.com/news/424149-skripal-poisoning-bz-lavrov/). 

Which links to a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/SpiezLab/status/985243574123057152) from the Swiss lab, Spiez Laboratory (zerohedge does not include this info)

RT:

&gt;The Spiez Laboratory reflected on Lavrov’s words, tweeting late Saturday that only the OPCW “*can comment [on] this assertion.*” 

[The tweet in question:](https://twitter.com/SpiezLab/status/985243574123057152)

&gt;Only OPCW can comment this assertion. But we can repeat what we stated 10 days ago: **We have no doubt that Porton Down has identified Novichock**. PD - like Spiez - is a designated lab of the OPCW. The standards in verification are so rigid that one can trust the findings. #Skipal

 I can't find it now but one of their tweets linked to a German article from April 4th interviewing the head of their chemistry department. Even recommended a translator. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator). 

Glad I saved it, because i can't find it now. [Link to the article](https://www.nzz.ch/international/kein-zweifel-am-nowitschok-resultat-ld.1374775) and [image of the translation](https://linx.li/selif/germanarticle.png). I was going to summarise but don't really feel like it now. Good read though. 


He says its unlikely we'll ever know the origin of the Novichok. Which we already kind of knew I guess.


 [CNN's coverage of this has been stellar](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:cnn.com+Spiez&amp;hl=en&amp;gbv=1&amp;prmd=ivnsm) btw, naturally.

At least NYT [1](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/14/world/europe/14reuters-britain-russia-skripal-lavrov.html) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/14/world/europe/14reuters-britain-russia-skripal-lavrov.html) and [WashPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/europe/russia-trace-of-western-made-nerve-agent-seen-in-uk-samples/2018/04/14/c76a8b30-3ff7-11e8-955b-7d2e19b79966_story.html) gave themselves plausible deniabilty. ""no see we reported on it. look right here.""

One interesting point the German article makes is that a Russian Scientist immigrated to the United States ([in 1995](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-11-09/news/1995313120_1_weapons-convention-chemical-weapons-treaty)) and published a book describing Novichok substances in 2008. Before that it's likely that Russia was the sole Novichok nation. (I wouldn't rule out the possibility he was already teaching some US Government scientsists between 1995 and 2008 though.)

Another interesting point is that any country developing nerve agents is required to go on record about it with the OPCW, but Novichok doesn't fall into any specific class they identify, so there is no rule saying a country making Novichok needs to disclose it at all. Shits turnt.

The Russian Scientist who wrote the book blew the whistle on Russia's Novichok program in the early 90s, survived a charge of high treason from the Russian government, moved to the US in the mid 90s, gave testimonies in Congress in 19994 that were a key factor in Congress's decision ratify the Checmical weapons treaty that left Novichok off its list (e.g., despite Novichoks exclusion, the treaty is too important not to go ahead with anyway, unless i'm misinterpreting) [1](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-11-09/news/1995313120_1_weapons-convention-chemical-weapons-treaty)",conspiracy,1524631762,whatevawhatevvathroa,7,12,True,2018-04-25

201,"this is not a conspiracy, this is merely my thoughts.","there are no other intelligent things in the universe because they caused themselves to go extinct.

intelligence is a curse. to have such raw capabilities packed into something as small as a brain is a scary thing. 

our extinction is nigh as well.

increased reliance on the money and technology blinds us to our destruction of the world around us. we've contaminated water around us by spilling chemicals that kill anything that comes in contact. we've pushed species to extinction. we stuff our livestock full of hormones to satisfy the growing demand of food from the 8 billion people on Earth. we've pushed responsibilities out our hands with the Internet. AI will only exacerbate conflicts and cause millions of our own kind to be killed because of a ""miscalculation"". 

the technological future sounds great on paper, until you realize that every effort towards that future only pushes us to the limits of what nature can handle. 

humans were first nomadic hunters, and stockers. we thought ahead. the Iriquois tribe, without any contact with any such advanced tools,  taught seven year sustainability. 

""In every deliberation we must consider the imapct on the seventh generation."" 

humans were not meant to be social. nature's law of ""battling things out to the death"" was to be kept. it's NATURALLY how things work, in every class of animal. the population of any class was always kept even.

we figured out irrigation. we grew crops. we traded goods. all is well. the law of nature is kept.

as people became more and more adept to creating tools and medicines that prolonged the life of humans, and kept predators at bay, nature began to become disrupted. 

money threw the barter system out of the proverbial window. these metal coins had their value placed on them by how much the raw materials were worth at the time. but who declared such materials were worth a certain amount? 

European inventions made life easier. made work less strenuous. as Europeans pushed their way of life all around the world, COUNTLESS mistakes have been made and MILLIONS died as a result of the ""we're going to force our life unto you for our way is best"" mentality. industrialism kicked in, and everything was kicked into overdrive. 

there were profits to be made, at any cost. millions upon millions of square mileage was leveled for these factories. for homes, as the population boomed. there were no such thing as predators. humans were top of the food chain. we controlled every animal, plant, every inch of the world. 

the quality of life for humans BOOMED, while our narrow mindedness has brought destruction to the very nature that created us in the first place. we compare our situations to others, as social beings. as a society, we have been conditioned to focus on one tree, instead of viewing the forest. 

our thirst and reliance on money has ruined our way of life. 

our medicines disrupt natural law. many of the diseases we collectively see are because of our prolonged lifespan. the longer we live, the more resources we require. we have 8 billion people on Earth. there isn't a predator to level off our population, and that's why the world is in the shape it's in. there's just too many of us.

our technological advances disrupt natural law. we were given logical brains to be used as a way to elude predators. to problem solve. all we have done is try to make OUR lives easier at the expense of everything else. we have created objects like the cell phone, and cars, but what other animal requires objects like these? we are placing reliance on AI to control our missile defense, to drive us around, to order things off of Amazon for us. 

our intelligence is destroying everything. we have contributed to the Earth getting hotter. to abnormal weather patterns. to stronger and stronger storms. we have caused thousands of species to go extinct. we have launched nuclear arms at each other, killing the whole ecosystem.

in the short span of 500 years, we have caused a chain of events that cannot be reversed. no matter how hard we try. the end of life as we know it, is in fact coming very soon.

as I previously stated, being intelligent is a curse. there are absolutely no upsides to it. no other animal possesses the power we have. nature hadn't created intellectual beings, capable of anything and everything, before us. 

I wonder why.

249,"Osama bin Laden’s bodyguard has been living in Germany and receiving more than $1,400 a month in welfare payments, according to a new government report.","&gt;A man accused of working as Osama bin Laden’s bodyguard has been living in Germany and receiving more than $1,400 a month in welfare payments, according to a new government report.

&gt;According to the Evening Standard, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has been paying Sami A. and his family 1,168 euros, or $1,430, a month for welfare, despite previously being considered a “danger for public safety” by a German court.

&gt;Sami A., whose full name cannot be revealed due to German privacy laws, has been under observation since 2006 and is suspected to still be involved in Islamic terror circles.

&gt;He found himself in Germany more than two decades ago on a student visa and allegedly trained at one of bin Laden’s terrorist camps in 2000. According to the Washington Post, his involvement with al Qaeda and bin Laden was revealed in a 2005 trial in Dusseldorf, Germany.

&gt;Sami A. denied being involved with the terrorist organization, but the court still found him “an acute and considerable danger for public security” and therefore denied his asylum request. However, he wasn’t deported back to Tunisia out of fears that he would be tortured there.

&gt;News of his welfare payments was revealed by the staunchly anti-immigration party, the Alternative for Germany party, which addressed it in a regional parliament session.

&gt;The group released a statement opposing his stay in Germany, writing: “What fate awaits Sami A. in Tunisia is not the problem of German taxpayers.”

If he was OBL's bodyguard he did a mighty shitty job. And why would Germany harbor and support him?  None of these publications covered any kind of actual government hearing; no transcripts, no bills, no minutes, no links.

And if it works for computer hard drives, why not all phones too? They use the same flash memory drives.

302,The Theory Of Gender Inversion,"​There is no question that the media presents androgyny the height of sexual appeal.

​

I believe that pretty much anything you see happening on the dark occult side is probably some sort of twisted version of Godly Truth. I think when someone really aligns with God, that their male and female aspect will combine spiritually.

​

Someone like that is beyond gender and spiritually very powerful. Physically however, they will be the gender they were at birth. I doubt God would be in favor of mutilating children away from their birth gender through hormones and surgery.​

​

With that said, there is no question in my mind that many elites are gender inverted. Since I live in a beach resort town where elites “summer” I really couldn’t understand why I looked nothing like these “rich women”. I was always kind of round and soft while many of the rich “women” were extremely thin Claudia Schiffer types.​

​

Jungle Surfer is one of the first people to have started identifying gender inversion amongst celebrities. While I don’t always agree with his conclusions, he does his best to show why he believes what he believes.​

​

Here he is saying The Rolling Stones were born as women.​ Is Jungle Surfer insane to believe this? Is he making a good point? Can you see this as well?

305,FBI Arrests Cop For Selling Drugs—On Duty—From His Own Patrol Car,"﻿

Newark, NJ — A police officer in New Jersey was arrested by the FBI after he was caught selling drugs out of his patrol car and near the police department, in a sting set up by undercover agents.

Ruben McAusland, 26, reportedly sold roughly $12,000 in drugs to an undercover buyer who was working with the FBI, US Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a statement. McAusland is accused of selling at least 35 grams of marijuana, 48 grams of heroin, 31 grams of cocaine and 31 grams of crack between October 2017 and April 2018.

According to the statement from the FBI:

“In February 2018, McAusland offered to sell the individual one kilogram of cocaine. Then, on multiple occasions between February 2018 and April 2018, McAusland allegedly sold the individual pills that were made to resemble Percocet doses but were actually made of heroin. McAusland sold the pills to the individual for approximately $7 per pill.

On Feb. 11, 2018, McAusland met the individual in his police vehicle at a supermarket parking lot near the Paterson Police Department headquarters. McAusland handed the individual approximately four sample heroin pills. Afterwards, on various dates in 2018, McAusland sold heroin pills to the individual, including a sale of 1,010 pills on April 1, 2018 for $7,000.”

“It’s a surprising case—that an officer, who is supposed to be preventing the sale of drugs, did just the opposite,” FBI spokesman Will Skaggs said.


However, police corruption in the war on drugs is more than a matter of just “a few bad apples.” In fact, the conditions that are created by prohibition guarantee that police will take advantage of their position to act outside of the law since they are less likely to get caught or face any consequences if they do. Police are often unsupervised when finding large amounts of drugs or money that far surpass the value of their paychecks, so there is no wonder that stories of drug dealing cops are a common occurrence.

McAusland is not the first cop to get caught selling drugs out of his car either—back in 2015, The Free Thought Project reported on the story of Officer Donald Jordan from Anderson Indiana, a cop that worked security at a local school who was caught selling drugs.

Jordan was corrupt in many more ways than just selling drugs. In one of the reports against him, it was said that he gave a woman three hydrocodone pills and demanded that she touch his genitals instead of giving him money. When she refused, he reportedly exposed himself and physically forced her hand into his lap.

According to one of the witnesses, Jordan said that he was a “better criminal than he is a cop” and even admitted that he was “corrupt.”

In the case of McAusland, most of the deals he made were extremely high value, and if convicted of all of the charges against him, he faces up to 40 years in prison. Although, it is rare for an officer to see the type of sentencing that the average person would—they often end up getting a slap on the wrist.

In another case from 2015, Perry Betts, one of the most corrupt narcotics officers in the history of the Philadelphia Police Department, was fired for selling drugs, rehired and then fired again. His rehiring came after he was acquitted in a federal corruption case, in which he was accused of 47 different charges including extortion, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing.

Betts was acquitted of all of those charges along with six co-defendants who were also Philadelphia Police Officers implicated in the conspiracy. The officers were not only acquitted on all 47 counts, but they also got their jobs back and were even given a parade.

Meanwhile, people who are caught with these same substances have their lives torn apart, sometimes to the point of disrepair, and the country’s drug abuse problem has only gotten worse.

According to a U.S. government study, released by the National Center for Health Statistics, drug overdoses in the U.S. have increased by 23 percent between the years of 2010 and 2014.

In certain areas of the world, like Portugal, where all drugs have been decriminalized, there are far fewer overdoses than there are in prohibition countries. The Washington Post reported earlier this year that drug overdoses are extremely rare in Portugal, and they have some of the lowest rates of addiction in the world. Also, there is growing evidence that a person’s social, economic and personal factors have a much larger impact on their probability of getting addicted than we previously thought.

319,"How music artists are spawns of Satan, and what God's true plan is for the people (Conspiracy theory not a Jahova's witness trying to spread religion)","So, I like to think of a lot of conspiracy theories. It's something that I find pretty fun/funny to do sometimes. So I was just thinking about how life works, because I was born a pretty smart kid, but I don't really do as good in school as I should, mainly because it's very boring. Even throughout all of that, I was still always put into the honors classes, and I was not an honors student. My teachers were always telling me to start handing in my work and they usually gave me decent grades on assignments I should've failed on just so I could pass. You might think that this is just normal teachers trying to get their students out of school with a diploma. My case is a bit different from that though. My teachers do not do that for most of the other students that are not good in school. I'm smart, but not good in school, so I perform the same in school as most people who just aren't as smart. It doesn't add up how I still get put in the honors classes. As I was thinking about things, it came across my mind that we are all given a duty in life by god. If these duties were performed, that would be my gateway to heaven. In my case, the teachers that always encourage me to start doing my work more and keep me in the honors classes were angels trying to get me to join heavens side. The basic plan for God for the people is to get education, start a family and have kids, and make money because you got educated at school and in church. To make money by working jobs that keep society going smooth and perfect. Kind of like one of those games where you run a civilization and you have to keep them evolving and upgrading and learning more and more things. On a real life note now that I'm done talking about a video game, that is the key way to make money and life a nice, christian life. But there are some different kinds of rich people. There are two kinds of rich people, those rich people that get good degrees and have a very high education that leads to well paying jobs. Then, there's music artists. Music isn't really something that keeps society going. And music artists are still filthy rich. There are some arguments that music keeps people going, but that's a whole different debate. Now, the type of artists that are going to be highlighted in this theory are rappers. Not all of them, but the ones who people claim are mumble rappers. The ones that just rap about drugs, sex, and all type of illegal and wild fun stuff that a person can do with a whole lot of money. A lot of these people dropped out of school and are still rich. These people are filthy rich and they do the exact opposite of what God's plan is to do. They don't get an education, most of them don't start families and stick to multiple women and do drugs and don't go to church and whatever else you would think of a sinner. These artists, are spawns of Satan. Most of these rappers are heavy sinners. They are spawns of Satan, trying to make people live that type of lifestyle. Satan is temptation, and these rappers try to tempt people to steer away from heaven and God. They want people to sin. Doing things such as smoke weed, or having a lot of hoes, is directly against God's plan. And then there's just normal people. People who don't really have a belief and also don't do sinful behavior. Normal people do okay in school, and get decent jobs that let them live an okay life. And these are the people who don't go to heaven or hell. These are the people who just reincarnate, and are just based off of pure science. They believe in facts only, and conspiracies are seen as a joke to them. The reason we don't know where we end up is because of the fact that we don't go to heaven or hell, we either just cease to exist or we reincarnate. That's all unknown though, because no matter what, you can't remember anything of your past life if you just die off.

Regarding Kanye, he seems to be a hot issue everyone is discussing now. Some people think he's ""exposing the elites"", others think he's just a narcissistic twat promoting his new album with some antics.

In this article (and all over Infowars Facebook page), you'll see Jones shilling for and promoting Kanye, who has apparently recently endorsed Trump.

**What's the potential angle of using somebody like Kanye West, who has incredible influence over the black culture, and potentially using him to drum up support for Trump among the black community?**

Anything Infowars covers is extremely suspect to me these days, given the fact that they have become nothing more than conservative propaganda and cheerleading for Trump as some kind of anti establishment ""good guy"".

343,The News Needs Better Writers In My Opinion If They Want To Fool The Masses With More Success.,"​I didn’t talk a whole lot about this Syria gas attack narrative when it first happened. If one were to believe the mainstream media narrative about this matter, we must buy that:

​

A Leader attacked his own people right when the military intruders said they were leaving.​

​

The US, Israel, Britain and friends care so much about regular people that they simply must solve their problems wherever they may reside.​

​

The solution to resolve the problems of regular Syrians is to bomb them until these “allies” can replace their leader with someone more friendly to the interests of the US, Israel etc.

​

I stopped watching movies from the oligarchs a long time ago because I felt they were poorly written with non credible plots and characters.​

​

I now believe big time movies and the news both comes from the same types who have clearly lost touch with the way real humans think and behave.

362,Could he be the Pendragon?,"Inside Camelot, the Pendragon and his Templar Knights discussed the fight. The enemy would return, again and again. They had to make a more serious plan and Merlin had something for the future.
For their own protection, the family was killed in legend, but the coward kings knew the Pendragon was hidden. They searched for him and made lies about who he was. While the Tyrants searched, the Templars kept silent.
The Knights crossed on ships with guns and took the new world. Part of the plan, but only the beginning. Lexington and lanterns, waiting, building and silence. 
The enemy and all the Tyrants together pressed against the Revolution. They made peace and pacts, shadow governments to mimic the fire where the phoenix egg lay, where the Pendragon slept. The Templar's old enemy was at the gate from the start, but sent back by leathernecks, new Knights sworn to old honor. Merlin's plan was set, hidden and well.
Everyone slept in Camelot. Only the Pendragon knew the awful truth, awake and watching, moving among the legends, leaving a mark in time as Merlin planned. Look at that smile. 
The Pendragon revealed himself to the Knights when they could wait no longer. When they would have acted without his blessing. Did they light a candle never lit before, one more lantern? Was the plan to come to light only when the Tyrants had come too close to DOOM?
The terror of the enemy closes in, rape and blood are in the streets. Cowards Kings plan to purge rather than search and the Knights meet their enemy again and again, witnessing secrets and every old horror. 
In the midst of the swamp and dreary battle of puppets, his laugh came through. A familiar face, smiling and strong, came cutting down great families and servants of coward kings. The people cheered from the galley. What great fun to have a hero, the underdog who stands up to those who harmed us.
When did we notice he was surrounded by Knights? No matter, come to the joust. He cut them all down and turned to the wicked witch. She staggered and spit up, none of the old magic could break the spells of the new. When did we notice he was surrounded by wizards? No matter, come to the dinner and watch him upset leaders in fancy dress, who make eyes to each other, sweat and sip with knotted brows.

368,newly uncovered Hildog emails dated 2010 through 2013 contain classified information and detail collusion between the Hildog State Department and the Hildog Foundation released by judicial watch today,"[source](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-new-Hildog-emails-reveal-classified-docs-Hildog-foundation-connections/)

&gt;Judicial Watch today released [281 pages](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687/) of newly uncovered emails of former Secretary of State Hildog from the U.S. Department of State sent and received over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system. The emails, dated 2010 through 2013, contain classified information and detail collusion between the Hildog State Department and the Hildog Foundation.

&gt;Ten emails contain [classified information](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/tag/hrc-emails-0318/) redacted “in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,” including confidential sources, and concern Israel and the Middle East. Most of the emails include exchanges with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The emails show Hildog conducted classified and sensitive negotiations about the Israel-Arab conflict on her unsecure, non-governmental server.

* A document labeled “[plan](http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pages-from-JW-v-State-HRC-emails-00687-32-33.pdf)” was completely redacted as classified.

* A November 2012 email chain discusses the [“Mid East”](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-76-77/) and includes then-Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan, Blair as “[aclb](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-Hildog/11837718/Hillary-Hildog-may-have-broken-US-secrecy-rules-with-emails-from-Tony-Blair-and-Downing-Street.html)” and Hildog.

* Another November 2012 [email chain](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-78-79/) discusses the “Mid East” and includes Sullivan, Hildog’s office manager Claire Coleman, Blair and Hildog.

* A November 2012[ email chain fully redacted](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-82-83/) is titled “Mid East Peace” and includes Blair, Hildog, Odama’s Special Envoy to the Middle East David Hale as “haledm2@state.gov,” Sullivan and Blair’s Chief of Staff and former Downing Street aide [Catherine Rimmer](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/investigations/tony-blairs-business-triples-profits-as-staff/).

* In an April 2011 email exchange between Blair, Hildog and Sullivan concerning “[Israel](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-108/),” Blair says he “had another long session with BB [Netanyahu].”

* A May 2011 exchange concerns “[Israel](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-130/)” and includes Blair, Hildog and Sullivan.

* A May 2011 email concerns “[Palestinians](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-132/)” and includes Blair, Hildog and Sullivan. Blair says, “I’ve also sent you a paper.”

* A June 2011 email regarding “[Israel](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-154/)” includes Blair, Sullivan and Hildog. Blair says, “Saw Israeli PM. Put the concept of a Q statement. He was receptive. Palestinians interested too. I know there are discussions also you guys are having. And the French initiative….”

* In a July 2011 email – with [several](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-171/) national security redactions – written by Blair to Hildog and Sullivan, Blair says, “I saw BB….. Molcho [chief negotiator in the Israeli negotiating team with the Palestinians] will speak to David Hale. I can see Cameron and Sarkozy with David…. I saw Egyptians….”

* A September 2010 [email exchange](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-242-244/) is titled “Info for you,” and includes Sullivan, Blair and Hildog. Blair writes that he just spent three hours with Netanyahu, and Sullivan, using his Sprint BlackBerry, he writes “We have pitched this to [redacted].”

These new classified and other emails appear to be among those that Hildog had attempted to delete or had otherwise failed to disclose. The documents are part of the November 2017[ accelerated schedule](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-court-orders-state-department-speed-production-Hildog-email-records/) of production[ ordered by U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg](http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JW-v-State-00687-November-30-Order.pdf). The State Department must now complete processing the remaining documents by September 28, 2018. There were 72,000 pages recovered by the FBI in its investigation into Hildog’s illicit email server. The State Department’s original production rate would have put the completion date into 2020.

The newly obtained documents came in response to a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on May 6, 2015, after the State Department failed to respond to a March 4, 2015, FOIA request ([Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State \(No. 1:15-cv-00687](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-00687-all-Hildog-emails/)) seeking:

All emails sent or received by former Secretary of State Hildog Rodham Hildog in her official capacity as Secretary of State, as well as all emails by other State Department employees to Secretary Hildog regarding her non-“state.gov” email address.

Many of the emails involve Abedin, who joined the State Department as deputy chief of staff[ in 2009.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin) From June 2012-February 2013, she was granted status as a [“special government employee](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-for-records-on-controversial-state-department-consulting-agreement-for-former-Hildog-aide-huma-abedin/),” allowing her to work as a consultant to clients like [Teneo](https://www.judicialwatch.org/bulletins/teneo-the-Hildog-machine/) and served as a paid consultant to the Hildog Foundation.

Several of the emails demonstrate the commingling of Hildog State Department and Hildog family foundation business:

* In a November 2010 email with subject line, “[How do I get through to Hildog's husband,”](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-30-31/) Rafael Anchia, a lawyer with Haynes Boone, asks Hildog campaign official Ed Meier if he could get to the “gatekeepers” to get Hildog's husband to give a speech in Spain, noting that “a large bank is willing to pay for it.”

Meier forwarded the email to former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan who forwarded it to former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin. Abedin sent it to Hildog's husband’s scheduler at the Hildog Foundation, Terry Krinvic, who provided Hildog’s contact information, to which Sullivan responded, “Awesome.”

* In September 2011, [Abedin sent Sullivan an email](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-187-189/) concerning the Hildog Global Initiative (CGI) with “Potential questions for Closing Plenary conversation between Secretary Hildog and Chelsea Hildog” in which Abedin included some “proposed questions” to put to Hillary and Chelsea Hildog. Four days later, Sullivan forwards a revised list of questions (completely redacted as interagency deliberative process) to Abedin and Hildog’s Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, saying, “Here are my proposed questions.”

* In a September 2010 email containing subject line,[ “President Banda’s MOU \[Memorandum of Understanding\] with Hildog Global Initiative,”](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-38/) U.S. Ambassador Jeanine Jackson writes to Hildog Development Initiative official Walker Morris, (cc’d to Hildog Foundation official Amitabh Desai) discussing State Department spending in the country of Malawi. In the email, Jackson says, “we will be anxious to collaborate once you have an idea of the MOU’s intent.” Morris responds that “we are very excited about CDI’s [Hildog Development Initiative] future work in Malawi and certainly see great opportunity to collaborate.”

The Hildog Foundation work in Malawi involved a Hildog Foundation owned “for-profit agribusinesses including Tukula Farming Company which operates 7200 acres of commercial farms” in the impoverished country.

Other emails show that Hildog's husband appears to conduct State Department and Hildog Foundation business simultaneously:

* In a September 2012 email with subject line “[Burma](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-59-60/),” Desai briefs Jake Sullivan on Hildog's husband’s discussions in Burma. Desai reports, in part: “WJC mentioned work of CF [Hildog Foundation] and offered to help in any way. TS [Than Shwe, president of Burma] said he already had asked HRC about WJC foundation and wanted to invite WJC foundation to work in myanmar in collaboration with gov agencies and other ngos … TS invited WJC to open offices in Rangoon and Mandelay.” That same day, Abedin writes Desai (cc’s Mills, Sullivan, Fuchs and three other persons whose email address are redacted) with subject line “Re: He had v good meeting with Libya and Burma:” “hrc looking forward to hearing about Burma. We meet at 545. I believe you have downloaded to jake?”

* In a September 2012 email with subject line [“Columbia / President Santos,” Desai](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-26/) and Toiv discuss a request by Colombian president, Manuel Santos, that Hildog's husband say some positive words about Santos’ initiative reaching out to the FARC terrorist group. Santos provided the Hildog Foundation with suggested language. Toiv said that she would “check” and also mentioned that she was working on a “visa issue.”

According to a report in the [New York Post,](https://nypost.com/2016/10/15/Hildog-foundation-more-concerned-with-bills-pal-than-colombias-poor/) the Santos request came not long after Hildog “jetted in for a Pacific Rubiales golf tournament at the Bogota Country Club… Accompanied by Giustra, he played a few holes with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.” The event reportedly raised one million dollars for the Hildog Foundation.",conspiracy,1524692654,whatevawhatevvathroa,68,177,True,2018-04-25

376,(1017). Another Mafia style murder intimidation,"


(1017). Another Mafia style murder intimidation (4/24/2018)

After the failure of the murder attempt of September,2017 (The case was signaled by the sixth nuclear test of N. Korea) see #979, 980, 981. The Feds immediately issued a murder signal on my wife. (see #981) In that case they intend to kill by ""Lupus Erythematosus""
disease.

This time too, after my wife returned from ""Late March Taiwan tour"", they issued another intimidation. 

On 4/10, when I clicked on the IPad, the screen showed the site of ""World Journal"" though I hadn't chosen it. Then the screen was covered by a whole page English commercial.(""World Journal"" is a Chinese media) It was advertisement of an insurance company about car accident. Though commercial is common in Internet, it used to be small. I haven't seen such a big one cover the whole page. I think that was an intimidation from the Feds. They will murder by ""car accident"". I have no drive license and stay at home to avoid any possible plots. It was used to deal with my wife when a foreign tour plot failed. 

(981). Attempt to murder my wife (9/12/2017)

I have warned Korea war crisis would be created to cover up the framed case of 9/2. N.Korea did detonate a nuke bomb on 9/3. If US reacted with ""fire and fury"" Trump had promised, my predict would have become true. The procedure was so closely carried out. Only the Feds failed to frame me in any framed case. Then the Feds immediately designed another murder case - to kill my wife. 

The Feds used to influence public opinion by TV commercial. on 9/6 and 9/7, an organization had an ad on KTSF26(Chinese) to remind people of ""Lupus erythematosus"". It was so shortlived(2 days) that I never saw it after 9/7. What I remember of that ad was some people having a parade with banners written ""Lupus ...""I even couldn't finish reading the whole banner because the banner was upright, the English was so rare seen.  I was confused the first letter was ""I"" or ""L"". I knew it was ""lupus erythematosus"" only by audio Chinese aside. 

Decades ago when I was a in HongKong, I knew an acquaintance of my parents - Mrs. Wang. Mrs. Wang was a rich widow. She lived with a close friend - Ms. C. Mrs. Wang had a quick death - died of Lupus erythematosus. Although people knew she had such a disease, nobody expected she'd have a sudden death. The gossip in their social circle was: how much did Ms. C got from Wang's wealth. 

In US, when I knew G-man and realized he is a double agent, I also knew Ms.C is G-man's sister. I also found the Feds are money looters. That made Mrs. Wang's death a thoroughly different story to me. Lupus erythemotosus could be a killing tool of the intelligence. 

I don't think the short lived commercial of Lupus Erythematosus is a coincidence. The disease is incurable and victims mostly are women. In #979. I wrote,"" If I were arrested when my wife was absent, nobody would have known that I was in prison. This time my wife travels to Canada from 9/2 to 9/9. The Feds could have seven days to do a ""suicide"" death."" The words might touch off the killing motive. If my wife doesn't exist, that's more convenient for them to do a murder case.

382,"Scry, a site to aggregate opinions to predict the future","Scry is building a two-sided market to predict the future

On one side of the market, we are building on emerging research on cognition and judgement that has uncovered the existence of latently prescient individuals; these individuals were found over a 5-year geopolitical prediction competition, where they consistently beat out the rest – even intelligence experts by a staggering margin of 30%.
Dashboard

We are taking what those researchers have found, to not only to find more of these people across the world, but to give others the opportunity to be trained to think like them as well.

On the other side, we are serving a need that our own market surveys have revealed: over 96% of managers and business owners in across the Western hemisphere say that they are experiencing a crisis of confidence when it comes to making strategic decisions for their organisation. They blame their woes on the poor quality of information they have access to – typically, newspapers, renowned experts in the industry, and TV news networks. What Scry is going to serve up is a no-fluff probabilistic estimate of the outcomes of future events; no prevaricating and hedging with ""maybes"", ""probably-s"", or ""likely-s"".

And tying it altogether is Machine Learning. We are using it to advance the state of the art; both to identify positive traits that can be passed on through training to our predictor user base, and to boost the accuracy of the predictions served to our subscribers.
Ultimately, we want to build enough supply and demand in this space that a marketplace to connect organisations with competent predictors of the future becomes a viable prospect.

400,"Could ""They"" Hide God?","**Introduction**

“But you can't prove God exists. And isn't that what all science is ultimately about? Proving theories about the universe?""

""Provability is not truth, Caro. Godel's incompleteness theorem tells us that, if we didn't already know it intuitively, which we do.” ― Anna Jarzab (The Opposite of Hallelujah)

What exactly is *Godel’s incompleteness theorem*?

""Gödel's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems (true mathematical statements), proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.
Mathematicians once thought that everything that is true has a mathematical proof. A system that has this property is called complete; one that does not is called incomplete. Also, mathematical ideas should not have contradictions. This means that they should not be true and false at the same time. A system that does not include contradictions is called consistent.
Gödel said that every non-trivial (interesting) formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent: [1]

1.	There will always be questions that cannot be answered, using a certain set of axioms;
2.	You cannot prove that a system of axioms is consistent, unless you use a different set of axioms .

Those theorems are important to mathematicians because they prove that is impossible to create a set of axioms that explains everything in math.""

(https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).""

In other words, not all “truth” has proof that we can see – sometimes it is intuitive. Many people ask for evidence of God, claiming they cannot see proof of God in any way, but they may not realize proof may come in other forms. I am NOT here to prove or disprove God - you can do that on your own time. Again, I am not here to argue whether or not God exists – you can reach your own conclusions. It is also important to note that I understand that Godel’s theorem is about mathematics, but I still feel that its general notion can be applied to other areas, like spirituality. 

**To reiterate, this post is not meant to prove or disprove God. If you hate God, this post may not be for you.** Rather, this post is to discuss that hypothetically, if God did exist, then here is how and why “they” would hide him. Let’s start with how.  

**Creativity**

“Every child is an artist. The problem is staying an artist when you grow up.” – Pablo Picasso

In order to hide God, it starts in schools with the education system.  In order to understand a creator, one would have to understand the creative process. Now, unfortunately, there are misconceptions about “creativity.” Creativity is not necessarily artistic – and that is something many schools, teachers, and students get wrong. Rather, creativity, according to google, is “the use of imagination or original ideas.” This can come in many forms from art to music to writing to building. Creativity is not bound by art. 

Creativity, further, is the highest level of learning according to [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/). Verbs associated with creativity include design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, and investigate. 

Unfortunately, opportunities for creativity in schools today are sparse, and according to Forbes, [America’s education model kills creativity and entrepreneurship](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darden/2015/03/19/how-americas-education-model-kills-creativity-and-entrepreneurship-2/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/).

The article states, “Based on scores from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, her study reveals ‘that children have become less emotionally expressive, less energetic, less talkative and verbally expressive, less humorous, less imaginative, less unconventional, less lively and passionate, less perceptive, less apt to connect seemingly irrelevant things, less synthesizing, and less likely to see things from a different angle.’ That is depressing.”

Schools reinforce the concept that all ideas must be taken from somewhere else. I want to caution here that there is nothing inherently wrong with that. As I write this post, many of my ideas are coming from different sources, and today, synthesizing information is important. However, the problem is that there is a lack of time for truly creative opportunities, and I lean on this side that this might be purposeful. 

If one has little opportunity to create, how can one understand something that creates? For example, an artist may destroy an entire piece of art work because it does not meet his/her expectations, and others may not understand why. Only the artist could understand. By the way, I am not using this metaphor to justify a God who destroys. Again, I am just stating that the more opportunities we take away for students to create, the less they are inclined to understand creation (or the opposite…destruction) itself.

**To Enjoy Nature is to Enjoy God** 

“My profession is to always find God in nature.” - Henry David Thoreau

As our world becomes more industrialized, fewer and fewer have the opportunity to see nature in its truly, well, natural state. In fact, a Yale study says that there is a [widening disconnect with nature](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/u-s-study-shows-widening-disconnect-with-nature-and-potential-solutions).

The article also states, “Parents of children 8 to 12 years old said that their children spend three times as many hours with computers and televisions each week as they do playing outside.”

It is no surprise that there are many benefits of being in nature, such as [reducing depression and improving overall well-being](https://www.medicaldaily.com/benefits-ecotherapy-being-nature-fights-depression-improves-mental-health-and-well-being-261075).

In fact, the article states that “nature deficit disorder” is a real phenomenon.

And even if you do not believe in a specific God, there is no denying that there is something “divine” about nature itself.
Yet, people are jam-packed in cities with little access to nature, and much of the nature that many see is manufactured, polluted, destroyed, degraded, or disrespected. Even think about tourist spots, where one cannot even truly appreciate the nature they see. 

How can one understand a creator if they cannot experience the world in its natural state?

**Materialism**

“Many scientific disciplines begin by not observing any sort of vital spark or consciousness in material events and proceed to deny that these things exist in living things, including themselves. Because consciousness does not fit into their mechanistic schemes they declare it illusory. Magicians make exactly the reverse argument. Observing consciousness in themselves and animals, they are magnanimous enough to extend it to all things to some degree—trees, amulets, planetary bodies, and all. This is a far more respectful and generous attitude than that of religions, most of whom won't even give animals a soul.” ― Peter J. Carroll, Liber Null and Psychonaut: An Introduction to Chaos Magic

For those reading, I actually do not necessarily agree with the entirety of this quote, but I want to ensure I am bringing in different perspectives (not just my own Christian bias).

Today, many hold a scientifically material worldview, which states, “Scientistic materialism is a philosophical stance which posits a limited definition of consciousness to that which is observable and subject to the scientific method.” This goes back to my original point, though, that just because something is true, does not mean it is necessarily going to be “observable.” One may feel God in nature, but that is pretty difficult to “prove.”

I am not here to bash science, or say that this worldview is “wrong”, but the problem with this worldview is that it is possible that there is something beyond what we can observe through the scientific method. 

From Scientific American, “[According to the physicist John Wheeler, quantum mechanics implies that our observations of reality influence its unfolding. We live in a ""participatory universe,"" Wheeler proposed, in which mind is as fundamental as matter. Philosopher David Chalmers, Nagel's colleague at New York University, conjectures that ""information,"" which emerges from certain physical configurations and processes and entails consciousness, is a fundamental component of reality, as much so as time, space, matter and energy](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/is-scientific-materialism-almost-certainly-false/).”

With scientific materialism, comes materialism itself, which I will discuss a little later. 

**Nihilism/Absurdism**

Today, in pop culture especially, I see the emphasis on the meaningless of life, particularly in the ever popular “Rick and Morty.” Here is a pretty fun [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWU25NiWC7A) about the philosophy of nihilism and absurdism behind the show.

If you do not feel like watching, here is a good summary:

“Drawing inspiration from the science fiction horror pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft and based on a philosophical school of thought called Absurdism, “Rick and Morty” explores the conflict between the human tendency to seek meaning in life and the subsequent inability to find any. Sharing a common theoretical basis with existentialism and nihilism, the absurdity that unfolds in each episode is based on the idea that its characters are relentlessly caught up in a dichotomy with meaningless, illogical situations and actual life.”

https://studybreaks.com/culture/the-philosophy-of-absurdism-in-rick-and-morty/

Rick and Morty is not the only popular show that pushes this worldview, as it can be found in the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, and many more, and these programs have massive influence on the masses and their worldviews. 

The point is that scientific materialism breeds nihilism, and popular culture reinforces this nihilism. 

[Nihilism is certainly on the rise](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-is-nihilism-on-the-rise_us_5849ab9be4b0afda6e983ef8), and even if you disagree with my beliefs on the cause of this increase, it is clear that we are living in a world where many simply and firmly believe life has no meaning or purpose.

The problem is, what if people are wrong? That is the simple question. Again, it is not that “nihilism” is wrong, but proclaiming the world is absolutely meaningless is as a profound of a claim that life is absolutely meaningful. Both require proof; yet neither claims have substantial enough proof to be absolute.

Let us be clear though, one rarely hears about “God” or “Godly” things in pop culture, pop music, or pop anything really, which leads to my next point.

**Degradation**

“No one can live under degradation.” – Walid Jumblatt

In other words, how can we truly live if everything around us is in the state of deterioration?

Synonyms for degradation include shame, humiliation, debasement, degeneration, and deterioration. Though I cannot discuss every aspect of society in this limited post, I can discuss how degradation is celebrated today:

*Comedy* - Modern comedy is really about humiliation. Look, I am the first to laugh, but humiliation involves bringing someone else down at their expense, or degrading them. Today, I see thousands of “humiliation rituals”, whether on YouTube or social media. For example, the widely popular Ellen DeGeneres is pretty famous for humiliating her guests, after all. [In this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn3AgNC2TSk), she sets up a guest to steal something from her, and then she humiliates them in the audience. The point is that much of comedy today is meant to degrade others.

*Music* - It may sound cliché, but earlier I was talking to an older gentleman, and he said, “Music used to be uplifiting!” Even if you disagree with him, today’s music is certainly far from uplifting. Rather, most pop music (92%) is about [sex](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/). Even if not about sex, music itself has been to scientifically be worse than it used to be according to the [Smithsonain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/science-proves-pop-music-has-actually-gotten-worse-8173368/). A huge part of this comes from the fact that making money is much more important than making beautiful, creative music. Further, science really shows [all pop music sounds the same](https://mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same#.pbSF3CzAM). The themes in pop music today do not go beyond sex, drugs, violence, and everything that seems to be the opposite of “Godly” standards.

*Art* While I cannot speak of all art in this post, I am pretty disgusted by much of art today, like [poop art]( https://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/gloriously-offensive-art-show-san-francisco-i-poop-you/6476/) and [period art]( https://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/gloriously-offensive-art-show-san-francisco-i-poop-you/6476/). It is interesting because many complain about modern art, but maybe what they are not realizing is that they may not like modern are because it is often based on degradation - not creation.

For the sake of time, other parts of our society that have degraded are our food and water sources, our natural environments, families, and much more. 

Our society itself seems to be near its end stages (or at least many seem to think), and this article goes more into its [cultural collapse](http://www.returnofkings.com/49185/cultural-collapse-theory-the-7-steps-that-lead-to-a-complete-culture-decline).
Speaking of cultural decline, there also seems to be a rise of cultural decadence…

*An analogy for you*: Nihilism is to absurdity as cultural decline is to cultural decadence?

**Worship of Everything BUT God**

“The greatest act of faith takes place when a man finally decides that he is not God.” ~ Johann Wolfgang Goethe

Finally, while many detest the idea of God, I find that they quite simply replace God with something else. 

•	There is a [sex addiction epidemic](www.newsweek.com/sex-addiction-epidemic-66289). This [article](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/11/cheap-sex-explains-decline-marriage/) claims that cheap sex is responsible for the decline of marriage. 

•	[American drug use is on the rise](https://www.unityrehab.com/blog/american-drug-use-trend-on-the-rise/).

•	[Obesity is on the rise and linked to food addiction](https://www.thecabinchiangmai.com/obesity-rates-in-america-linked-to-food-addiction/).

•	Endless greed, [specifically corporate greed](https://www.rd.com/culture/corporate-greed/) is a fact of life. 

•	[Gambling addictions are on the rise](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700169522/Gambling-on-the-rise-Is-America-becoming-addicted.html).

•	[Internet addiction and online game disorder](www.thetechedvocate.org/internet-addiction-online-gaming-disorder-rise/) are on the rise.

•	[Phone addiction is real](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/12/11/phone-addiction-is-real-and-so-are-its-mental-health-risks/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/).

•	Did you know [celebrity worship syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_worship_syndrome) is a real thing, too?

What hole are we trying to fill? Are people feeling increasingly ‘empty’ in this nihilistic, apathetic world? What ‘void’ are we trying to fill? Is this void God? Are all of these addictions the false idols of today? As we see the rise in a world without God, we also see in a rise in addictions to other things. There is certainly a correlation, anyway. When something consumes a person’s life, it becomes an act of worship. 

More than anything, though, people want to be Gods themselves. The worship of ‘self’ is what is changing, or degrading, society. Sure, addictions have always existed, but the world has changed drastically in the past few decades because of the idolization of oneself. 

There has been a rise in [narcissism](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/06/28/a-rise-in-narcissism-a-root-of-americas-crisis/), a decrease in [empathy](https://www.livescience.com/51392-will-tech-bring-humanity-together-or-tear-it-apart.html), and people are even marrying [themselves](https://www.livescience.com/51392-will-tech-bring-humanity-together-or-tear-it-apart.html)!

Is it no wonder science says [faith is good for your health]( https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/8480505/Faith-good-for-your-health.html), and there are some intriguing studies on [faith, prayer, and healing](https://onlinesurgicaltechniciancourses.com/2010/25-intriguing-scientific-studies-about-faith-prayer-and-healing/).

**Conclusion…Why?**

“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” - Buddha

Whether you believe in God or not, you probably agree with this quote. It means that the materialistic things that most try to use to fill a void simply do not fill that void. We cannot find peace in this external, materialistic world. I mean, here is a [classic study](https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html) on how winning the lottery really does not make anybody happier.  

But why would *they* want to hide God? For one, if people believe in a God, they are likely to put God first in life, especially over “the powers that be.” They may question the motives of those in power. Why do you think they control religion in the first place ? – so they can control God. 

Second, if there really was a God, that means much of what we stress about in life may become somewhat meaningless – the money, the cars, the sex, the things we are all slaves to. People may question the reality they are living and realize how empty it is. They may change their lives, realizing they do not need any of those things to be content. Those things are literally “chains” for most people (including myself!).

Third, if there really was a God, then people cannot be Gods themselves, and there may be more to life than them. People’s entire paradigms would shift.   

I hope you enjoyed reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Also, please do not downvote me because you do not believe in God, as this post is meant for discussion and learning! : )

Bro I just tripped and saw all of my fleshy ideas of things strip away, like some kind of wheel, the Earth is. It just spins, crashing into all things, the creator of all things. 

All people do this, but I especially suffer from *dwelling* on the past and future. I’m a huge history and science nerd, so times, dates, events, and experiences are always replaying in my mind 24 hours a day. When I lost the love of my life it just got worse, I remembered everything we had done the previous year, and paired it with what I was doing around that time the current year. I still do this, *another year later* 

It’s horrifying. Like being trapped in the twilight zone. 

I’ve noticed when I do drugs (my drugs of choice are cocaine, ecstasy, mdma, and adderall), which I have done more of this last 12 months than the previous 60 months put together, I live in the moment. The dates, the times, the places, the people; nooooonnnne of it matters. All that matters is how beautiful *that* over there is, how wonderful *this* moment is, how much I have *right now.* 

But I can’t seem to fully drag those things into my sober life. I’ve had my bouts with paganism and meditation etc, but lately I can’t focus unless I’m doing some kind of drug.

408,"Is there conspiracy why Jews chose to live everywhere, especially Germany and yet complain about antisemitism all the time?","Of late, stories of Jew being attacked in Germany, France and U.S \(one incident each\) has been making headlines everywhere.

Coincidence?

[Photo: The Rothschilds - Germany gave these Russian Jews refuge and allegedly, they financed  Adolf Hitler to barbeque Jews in gas chambers.](https://i.redd.it/i5mn6mz0n5u01.png)

Anyway, the thing is Israel will not accept any non\-Jew but everywhere else must not only give them citizenship, also must legislate law to protect them.

Of particular interest is Germany. Proponents of ""Six Million Jews"" claimed all Jews in Germany have been holocausted.

However, records show that Jews are in Germany all the time.  From some 20,000 in the 1950s to some 150,000 today,  which make Germany the home of the fourth\-largest Jewish community in Europe.

Most came from former Soviet Union just like Rothschild, and surprisingly many are actually **Israelis**.

**Why do Jews still want to live in Germany, and keep relocating themselves to the place they consider as hostile to their community?**

Here is a commentary by an [Anonymous Jew ](https://www.quora.com/Do-Jews-still-live-in-Germany-and-if-they-do-how-are-they-being-treated/answers/30122087)\(which seems to suggest Germany is ""hell"" for Jews\): \-

&gt;I’m Jewish, with my paternal ancestors were German Jews. German Jews are Jews who lived in Germany for generations. Some of them lived there for dozens of generations, other immigrated to Germany from Eastern Europe only at end of the 19CE or at beginning of the 20CE, after Germany granted emancipation to its Jewish civilians. Before the emancipation, Jews were not allowed to live in German cities, they had to pay special Jewish tax when entered to such city, they were not allowed to enter it through the main gates and had to leave it by nightfall.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their history in Germany was really bitter one, meaning\- they been massacred in tens of thousands many times, from early times and up to the 19CE.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany was never a generous host for the Jewish people, though they contributed it significantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;People love to talk about how Germany changed its face. Well, pardon me\- I don’t buy it and for good reasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;There is Berlin, a cosmopolitan city, and there is Germany. Two different things. In Berlin antisemitism is not very common. Outside of it it’s a different story.  
&gt;  
&gt;In surveys done once in a while, between 20 to 30&amp;#37; of Germans admit that they are antisemitis. Practically it means that every German have in his / her circles few people who don’t especially like Jews, so it’s not like their defeat in WWII \(defeat, they didn’t stop for moral reasons\) somehow uprooted antisemitism.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new and very popular line in German literature that describe the Germans as the real victims of WWII, a war they started.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany is not allowed according to the international law to pay pensions to SS members for their “service”, even if they were not been trialed. As the international law define anyone who served in the SS as war criminal. However, Germany bypassed that by paying the pensions to their children and grandchildren. The pension sum is twice the sum that Jewish people who been in the death and forces labor camps for years, have most or all of their family murdered by the Germans, been through hell and remained with physical and/or psychological damage \(and certainly, all of their property was confiscated by Germany\) get.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany made very little efforts to bring Nazi criminals to justice. In some cases Nazis that were directly responsible for killing of hundreds of Jews were sentenced to few years in prison but never the less didn’t spend even one day in it. For instance\- Bruno Beger.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany signed huge weapon deals with the worst of Israel enemies along the years.

Suffice to say Germany is certainly no utopia to Jews.

And there is Israel that will always accept any Jew, real or fake. And then there is United States that is a virtual ""colony"" of Israel. So is UK, France, and many other places including Uganda \- which is the original Zionist target that escaped the ""Zionist Holocaust"".

On top of that, the German culture is not even kosher \- German are some of the biggest fans of PORK.  Lard is everywhere ... yet more and more Jews chose to settle in Germany and complain about antisemitism all the time.

# Question: Why Germany? Why not live in Israel? Is there a reason (or perhaps a conspiracy) to live in Germany, or anywhere else ... that we don't know about?

And if there is a good reason, why then Israel is closed to non\-Jews? How do you justify such discrimination?

Also, why do Jews see fit everywhere else must legislate law to protect them, even blackout media \(from reporting anything negative about Jews including lies and perhaps also crimes\), but the same is not only absent in Israel, in fact, persecution of non\-Jews is actually encouraged \(by the Netanyahu Regime\)?",conspiracy,1524706031,BuzzLima,38,0,True,2018-04-25

https://np.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/8exhoo/would_you_vote_sa_guilty/

If you are unfamiliar with the case, Steven Avery's lawyer believes evidence was planted. The lawyer sought to examine evidence from Steven's first false conviction, and he found [evidence harboring a broken seal.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5691be1b25981daa98f417c8/5691e2e50ab377deeed1dc21/5691e4ff69492ec8d740f662/1452401920873/blood-2.jpg) It was believed that if the blood at the scene of the crime was planted, it could have been taken from this blood vial stowed away in an evidence room. 

When blood is put in vials, experts use a chemical called EDTA as a preservative. If the blood samples from the crime scene contain EDTA, we would know for sure they were planted. The samples were sent to the FBI for testing, and the tests came back negative for EDTA.

You're probably thinking /u/TheWaterTemple stop beating around the bush and tell me about this BAMF Bruce Irvins.

At the time of the Stephen Avery blood test, Robert Mueller was still the director of the FBI. A Bush appointee, Mueller and James Comey headed a botched Anthrax investigation which began a couple weeks after 9/11. An investigation that took 10 years. 

Mueller and Comey's two prime suspects both worked at the same Army research institute. The first suspect, Steven Hatfill, was followed and harassed by federal agents for 6 years, and he successfully sued the government for its unlawful actions. He won $5.8 million.

Bruce Ivis became Mueller's second prime suspect after the Bureau separately ordered 2 tests of Bruce's Anthrax cultures. Records show conflicting results, one negative and one positive. The FBI did what they could to place Ivis at the location where the anthrax letters were mailed, but apparently it was physically impossible for him to make the trips.

A former FBI official involved in the anthrax investigation actually sued the FBI, alleging Robert Mueller,  James Comey, and the FBI concealed exculpatory evidence. Robert Mueller made his position known, saying, “I do not apologize for any aspect of this investigation,” and stated that the FBI had made no mistakes.

Bruce Ivins committed suicide. No autopsy was ordered following the suicide because it was ""determined that an autopsy wouldn't be necessary"" based on blood test results.",conspiracy,1524718370,TheWaterTemple,4,13,True,2018-04-26

448,Undersea cables provide 99% of internet connections and only 1% are from satellites. Does the map layout of cables help prove a flat earth or that there aren’t satellites orbiting in space?,"If you had asked me what technology is used to connect all these countries with one another to the internet my answer would have been satellites, but contrary to ignorant believe that’s not the case. With the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth  in 2000+ degree Celsius conditions, I surely thought that this technology would provide our wireless (wired) internet. 

With all of the vulnerabilities that these cables face laying on the ocean floor, it’s hard to imagine why they’d prefer this route. Especially with the added fear that Russia will cut these cables for the USA, completely effecting our economy and way of life, and set up a trap for any ships that attempt to fix the damaged lines. 

And when viewing a map layout to try and make sense of it all, you start to notice things that would only make sense on a flat earth map. Like how New Zealand is connected to Hawaii instead of South America. Despite metadump I mean metabunk trying to explain this away, it does create more questions than answers. I know that satellite dishes do communicate with certain towers and satellites that are grounded in earth. And I also know that when I’m in a plane looking down, I cannot see buildings as tall as the Empire State Building so how in the world can I see satellites that are much smaller and much further away when looking up at the sky?

Do I get upset when someone has an opposing view or proves me wrong? No! I’m happy when I’m proven wrong because I’m that much closer to finding truth.

449,Why is everyone on Reddit so vehemently pro-vax?,"I am anti-vax. Certainly not an expert on the issue, but as a conspiracy minded individual I tend to believe that there are some evil intentions behind the push for vaccinations. Some vaccinations are actually made out of human cancer and tumor cells and that has been approved by the FDA. They have even invented forms of mind control vaccinations. 

 There’s some serious propaganda behind this. First of all often times there is a pro vaccine article or something that pops up in the most popular feed. Scroll through the comments and anti-vaxxers get downvoted into oblivion. People are saying that anti-vax parents should be punished by the law for putting their child at risk. It just seems so weird. Humans have managed to survive millennia without the use of vaccines, why all of a sudden are they soooo necessary? Maybe there are some good things about them. But honestly people act like getting a vaccination is the single greatest determining factor of whether someone is going to be healthy or sick. And if they support throwing anti-vax parents into a jail cell, why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to binge on processed and packaged garbage? Why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to become obese? Why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to play video games all day instead of going and getting some exercise? I mean parents that allow their kids to do stuff like this, they would also be putting their children at risk. But nobody is vehemently supporting the idea that these people should be in a jail cell. 

And just the idea of mandatory vaccinations. It just feels so evil. It isn’t natural in any way. 

I know I’m probably preaching to the choir here but seriously what are your thoughts on this. I know Reddit is a site that leans heavily to the left, so perhaps this is not a good representation of the population at large. Just weird how vehemently these people support vaccines but you don’t hear a peep from them about chemicals and artificial preservatives that are proven to be unhealthy and harmful towards ones long term health.

463,Understanding the Bible Hermes/Moses.,"
The most ancient of all the Greek city-states that we have any history from is that of the city of Argos and it’s surrounding state called Argolis. The founder and first king of Argos was called Inachus and the first narrative myth involved his daughter Io. This myth was often referred to as the story of Hermes “Argiophontes”. Now, Io was identified with Isis among the Egyptians and the Syrian city of Antioch, formerly called Iopolis, had claimed to be her burial place. Hermes was identified with the Egyptian Thoth and the Babylonian Nebo.




Therefore you must realize that this earliest of civilizations known to the ancient Greeks did not originate in Greece itself, but obviously came as a colony from elsewhere, settling in Argolis with a developed mythology. The Argolian royal family had come up out of the land of Egypt.The Argolian colonists from Egypt.



And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.




God bestowed upon Moses a copper serpent that was to be attached to a stick and used for curative purposes. The mythical Greek character Hermes also carried a serpent stick called the “Caduceus” that was divinely bestowed upon him, and which became the worldwide symbol of the medical profession. . But, of course, it is also true that Moses had another “serpent stick” that he carried on his missions to bring God’s messages to the Pharaoh.




We are told by Jewish sources such as the writer Eupolemus, who wrote about 150 BC, that the alphabet was invented by Moses while, according to Greek sources, the same alphabet was invented by Hermes. The Egyptian Hermes -- whom they called “Thoth” -- is credited with inventing hieroglyphic writing while the Babylonian Hermes, whom they called “Nebo,” is credited with inventing cuneiform writing. Nebo, a word that means the “Prophet,” was a common nickname for Moses, and when Moses died he was buried upon Mount Pisgah which is also called, no doubt in memory of Moses, Mount Nebo.




Needless to say Moses was a prolific writer of sacred texts. In this regard Hermes was apparently no slouch either. So-called Hermetic books dealing with the religion of Egypt were mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Porphyry, and Jamblichus. Since Clement even says that the books of Hermes were carried by the Egyptians in religious processions, one surely wonders if they were kept in an ark like the law of Moses during the religious processions of the Israelites. However well known these Hermetic writings were in ancient times, it wasn’t until the middle of the 15th century that some of these previously lost Hermetic texts had supposedly been found in the libraries of the Byzantine Empire. Suspect though they are, these books are accredited to the semi-mythical figure named Hermes Trismegistus (thrice greatest) whom the Gnostics insist, while not being Moses himself, was a contemporary of his. an ever present characteristic of any image of Hermes is his petasos, a cap which featured a wide circular brim. The fact that this petasos looks, even to the casual observer, remarkably like the halo of a Christian saint may be a clue to it‘s origin. For the corona of Moses, which is Scripturally attested to at Exodus 34:30 (""and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him""), probably was represented pictorially as a circle around his head and, therefore, more than likely served as the origin of the petasos of Hermes.




Hermes also had another form of headgear that was intended to hide him, known as the cap of darkness or the helmet of invisibility. We know this because, according to Hyginus from his Astronomica (2.12), he once loaned it to Perseus: “Perseus ... received from Hermes, ... petasos, and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from being seen ... the helmet of Hades (the Unseen One)...” Moses also had a headdress that he wore for the purpose of hiding his face. His corona was frightening to people so he used a veil to conceal it, as explained in the book of Exodus at 34:33: ""And until Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.""




Hermes is often depicted as wearing winged sandals, but the Greeks would certainly know enough not to take this literally. The Greeks would understand that traveling upon wings was merely symbolic and meant nothing more than going swiftly. Moses was sent to deliver the Israelites upon eagles wings as at Exodus 19:4: ""You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.""




Casting of Lots Among the Greeks Hermes was considered to be the inventor of casting lots as a method of divination, but Moses also instructed the Hebrews, at a very early date, in the use of lots to divine the will of God. The iconoclastic Moses taught that no images should be made and, accordingly, there is some evidence that Hermes too was at first an iconoclast.



The name of Hermes originated in the Greek word “herma” meaning a “stone heap” -- probably from the custom of erecting a “herm” consisting of an upright stone surrounded at its base by a heap of smaller stones. These unpretentious monuments were often used as landmarks for travelers or to mark territorial boundaries. A mythical origin for these stone heaps may also be understood for, to quote from the Etymologicum Magnum, “when Hermes killed Argos, he was brought to trial by the gods. They acquitted him, and in doing so each threw his voting-pebble at his feet. Thus a heap of stones grew up around him.”




The point here being that the more recent images of Hermes result from apostasies of his earliest teachings, and that the original icon of Hermes, namely, the modest stone heap, was indeed one that would have been acceptable to even Israel himself. Notice Genesis 31:45-46: ""And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap.""




Moses taught that one out of every seven days was to be revered as holy and called the Sabbath, while Hermes also took one day out of the seven, calling it Wednesday after his name.



 In fact, this was noticed thousands of years ago -- at least as early as the second (some think that he could possibly have lived in the third) century BC -- by the Egyptian priest Artapanus who some think may have been Jewish. Eusebius (ix. 27) quoted from a lost book that was written by Artapanus and called Concerning the Jews that said of Moses “he was beloved by the Egyptians, who called him Hermes, (dia tên tôn‘ierôn gramattôn‘ermêneian).” The Greeks themselves seem to corroborate Artapanus by admitting that the Ibis headed Egyptian god Thoth was just another version of their god Hermes. The Greeks even tell a story of how Hermes had come up out of the land of Egypt where he once had lived disguised as an Ibis. Similar to the Hebrew Scriptures the followers of Moses, in the story told by Artapanus, were plagued by poisonous serpents.




However, the Moses of Artapanus (instead of the copper serpent) employed the Ibis to attack the snakes. This was the reason, Artapanus says, for which Moses/Hermes revered the Ibis so. If Hermes was Moses, as Artapanus states, and Moses was a younger contemporary of Inachus the father of Io, as cited by the ancient chronologists, then it is very conceivable that the Hermes in the story of Io’s wanderings is a mythic Greek version of Moses in the Hebrew story about the wandering Jews.




The earthly wife of god was in bondage, so god sent his serpent stick carrying messenger -- on eagle’s wings -- to lead her out of her captivity. The messenger of god smote the head of her captor and delivered the Earthly wife of god. Did he lead her directly home? No, this is when she went on her famous wanderings, known to the Greeks as the wanderings of Io. There was a mystifying cloud cover, a gadfly plague, and a miraculous water crossing. She gave birth to the ""Egyptian"" calf god, ""Epaphus"" (Apis). But, most telling of all, she approached the special mountain where the creator of mankind was bound, and talked to him. Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence. After all this she finally returned to her homeland, Phoronea.




“Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence.” This point, overlooked by many, is exceptionally strong evidence for equating the Greek and Hebrew traditions. A quote from Prometheus Bound (a play by Aeschylus, who wrote as early as 500 BC) runs thus: “PROMETHEUS: She (a future wife of Zeus) will bear to him a child, And he shall be in might more excellent Than his progenitor. IO: And he will find No way to fend off this strong stroke of fate? PROMETHEUS: None save my own self when these bonds are loosed. IO: And who shall loose them if Zeus wills not? PROMETHEUS: Of your own seed. IO: How says you? Shall a child of mine release thee? PROMETHEUS: Son of yours, but son the thirteenth generation shall beget. IO: A prophecy oracularly dark.” Is it not amazing how exactly -- down to the smallest details of theology -- that the Greek and Hebrew traditions match on this point? With the advent of this “savior” Prometheus would no longer be “bound” to the mountain.




How many stories do you know of where the creator of mankind will be released from his binding contract through the fulfillment of a prophecy predicting the future arrival of the son of god and the seed of a woman? (The story of Atlas is also remarkably similar but, as I hope the reader will come to realize, the two stories were intricately related.) The entire genealogy of the Greek savior -- all thirteen generations -- are known to this day as if it were the thirteen generations from Abraham to David!

I honestly welcome any actual evidence that proves that the Moon landings were a hoax. I am also going to debunk something that i find very irritating, which is this that ""rockets dont work in a vacuum"".

If you look on YT there is an alarming number of people making the demonstrably false claim. This seems like its either a psyop in itself, trying to make legit space conspiracies(like weapons on space, X37B style stuff) seem far fetched. It also seems to come from the same sorts of channels that spew flat Earth BS. 

Knowing what i do about fluid mechanics, specifically as it relates to turbomachinery and rockets, i find the idea that rockets dont work in vacuum laughable because to actually believe it, it requires a profound misunderstanding of how rockets, fluids and vacuum works.

The other thing i kept hearing is that ""the rockets go horizontal, and over the horizon, somehow indicating that they are landing.

Hello people who say that. Do you know what orbiting something means? It means going around it, not straight up from it. Of course its going to go horizontal for orbital insertion!

Its these kind of basic misunderstandings that lead to profoundly incorrect conclusions. 

These two videos show things behaving in ways you cant fake on Earth, leading me to the conclusion that the Moon landings were likely very real. Anyone who can offer reasonable explanations as to why debris or dust behaving the way it does in these videos, id love to hear them.

---
Yes it is. Always has been. Militarised for 70 years. Killing Russians was more important than a safe environment. All US plants are dying from old age. Too expensive.

There are 400+ nuclear plants on earth, China will build 400 more by 2050. The popular backlash against US nuclear power has sent nuclear expertise to Asia. America's infrastructure is crumbling and nuclear power threatens to contaminate us. It's too big to bail.

Then James Hansen comes out and says we can turn nuclear waste into money because the US can get 300 years clean power out of just our nuclear waste while making it safe.

James Hansen also said that giving the people back 100% of their carbon money will unite the US and be a highly effective way of uniting all humanity towards equality and lower emissions.

This makes James Hansen a social justice issue which I believe supersedes all other considerations. 

If all people got 100% of the money paid into energy, the rich would be giving money directly to the poor. This would rejigger our political economy, which is a good thing.

This so scared the political left, that green GMOS refused to endorse the Hansen plan. They poo pooed it. Then Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders passed a bill that said the government is entitled to 40% of that money. The story is always about the money. 

James Hansen's plan is a direct threat to the MIC/NGO industries. Greens won't support Hansen's plan, and neither does the military.

474,"Jesus Christ, Socialist?","﻿

by Christopher Williams


To start: I am a Marxist-Leninist, not a Christian. With that being said, I can’t help but love the figure of Jesus Christ in the Bible. In Christ, I see a fellow revolutionary, a radical community worker helping the oppressed at every point and pointing people to a new and better world. Jesus wasn’t a Marxist, as Marxism is socialism rooted in science and materialism, whereas, Christ’s politics are rooted in religion and idealism. However, Christ’s teachings are compatible with a religious based socialism utterly opposed to capitalism at every point, and thus, his followers must be also to be true Christians. All of the biblical quotes below will be taken from the New American Standard edition of the Christian Bible for the shear literal nature of its translation.

And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man. Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets. But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full. Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep. Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way.”  –  Luke 6:20–26

Now, the Beatitudes are generally considered the very core of Christ’s ethical teachings. Right out of the gates, we have Christ both recognizing that economic classes exist and immediately showing with which class he stands in solidarity and which class receives his disdain. This disdain for the wealthy classes is reiterated in the Parable of the Rich Fool:

And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’ “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’ “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.” – Luke 12:16–21

And again:

“No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.” – Luke 16:13

Capitalism is, of course, rooted at every point on the accumulation of worldly profits, and yet, Christ makes the exact opposite central to his doctrine of salvation:

A ruler questioned Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments, ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’” And he said, “All these things I have kept from my youth.” When Jesus heard this, He said to him, “One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. And Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” – Luke 18:18–25

Under capitalism we are told of the great value of self-interest, individualism, and competition, and yet, central to the New Testament’s message is again precisely the opposite. This is shown in the Parable of the Good Samaritan, as well:

“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” – John 13:34

And:

“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” – Galatians 3:28

“For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.” – James 3:16

“Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.” – 1 Corinthians 10:24

Further, how did the early Christians live? Did they seek out wealth and compete in enlightened self interest?

“And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common; and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.” – Acts 2:44–45

“And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them. And with great power the Apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all. For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the Apostles’ feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need. Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the Apostles, which translated means Son of Encouragement, and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the Apostles’ feet.” — Acts 4:32–37

That right there is what modern communists would refer to as primitive communism!

I’m sorry, but at this point, I’m just going to say if you preach Jesus Christ “Capitalist,” you are a false prophet.

Of course, all this anti-rich, pro-poor, and communal living rhetoric goes nicely with socialism, but I can hear the objections, “Socialism is about big government and a welfare state!” Well no, that is not necessarily what socialism is about; socialism, in the broadest sense, is about communal control of the means of production in society, which may or may not include big government and social programs.

“But socialism is about revolution and violence, Jesus was a pacifist!” Jesus did have pacifist tendencies at times if the “turn the other cheek” sort of verses are any indication, but contrary to most liberal narratives, Jesus was not entirely a pacifist and was no postmodernist looking to respect everyone’s beliefs:

“Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.” – Matthew 10:34

“He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters.” – Luke 11:23

Virtually the most important, and directly the main cause for his execution verdict, was an act of violence, the Cleansing of the Temple (John 2:13–16). Christ literally made a whip out of chords, charged through the temple, flipped tables over, and whipped moneychangers, driving them off the temple grounds. In modern terms, this is at least disorderly conduct and destruction of private property, if not inciting a riot.

There is also the fact that if one is truly serious about helping the poor and establishing a society in accordance with Christian principles, they need to realize that a socialist revolution may be precisely what is needed to make sure that these things are taken care of. They will also need to get it into their minds that such a revolution would result in a much lower death count than the grind of Capitalism that is still taking thousands of lives every day.

If you are truly serious about helping the poor, can you truly afford not to address the causes of their poverty? To tackle their oppressors? To drive the moneychangers out not merely from the temple but from the Kingdom of God that is in your midst?

“But the poor person does not exist as an inescapable fact of destiny. His or her existence is not politically neutral, and it is not ethically innocent. The poor are a by-product of the system in which we live and for which we are responsible. They are marginalized by our social and cultural world. They are the oppressed, exploited proletariat, robbed of the fruit of their labor and despoiled of their humanity. Hence, the poverty of the poor is not a call to generous relief action, but a demand that we go and build a different social order.” – Gustavo Gutiérrez

489,Was watching Blue is the warmest colour. Was pretty awkward...,"Hey Guys,

Firstly, I'm not trying to say this is a conspiracy, I just A. Thought it was kinda funny. B. I'm wondering if it happened to anyone else because I surely can't be the only one. C. Spend more time here than anywhere else and didn't know where else to put it. 

So, I was at home masturbating. Using a fleshlight I recently purchased. I shouldn't but now I feel like I need to justify myself. I'll be honest, haven't had sex in a while. Was in a relationship from 16 to like 22 and it ended pretty badly. I also got stung by a bee once that was pretty bad and now I'm not scared of bees but I'm aware of their ability to sting and my ability to accidentally kill them. My mate literally broke up with a girl, didn't get laid for a year. Then did, then moved in with her within a month and now has a kid at 21. So don't tell me that shit don't happen and forgive me for not seeing that as a wise decision. 

There's a few reasons why I've chosen to take a break from women or men, humans really. But the main one is I don't want to risk my priorities changing until I've done what I need to do. 

So, the fleshlight. Read a few threads on Reddit and the thought did actually occur to me that at some point I'm gonna get back in the game and I'm worried, I'll be useless. So 1. I had a realization that if you are going to masturbate, you may as well masturbate using a fake pussy? No one says shit when girls use fake dicks!? And just thought it would bridge the gap between my hand and a real vagina...

Jesus Christ haven't even got to the point of this post yet.

So, I'm watching some xhamster, xvideos or xnxx, some x website. Think I've started with some retro 70's shit. The idea that normal people in the 70's went to the cinema to watch porn fascinates me a lot. Suppose if you think about Trey and Matt's 1997 Orgazmo film we can start getting conspiratorial about the porn industry but not right now. 

Anyway, one of the recommended vids was a sex scene from 'Blue is the Warmest colour' 2013 movie. Go on then, I thought. These scenes are highly erotic which obvs you don't see alot of in movies.

In hind sight, should have just left it there but the movie caught my attention and I wanted to see it. Plus for me, porn is just better when there's a build up and I can at least try and pretend there's some human connection.  Prefer it if it's not highly obvious she's being paid or clearly does not want to be there. Sure others can agree?

So I'm watching this movie, it's French. Obviously. Like, I don't mean to be offensive but you see a highly sexual, artistic, indie flick with European looking people, it's probably French, right? Like you see a video of a cop jump through a moving car's window screen in pursuit of the driver, you know that happened in Russia. When you see a security/street cam film a stupid mother not watching her kid and a truck drive over them, you just know that probably happened in China.

That last one does sound offensive. But watch some videos on r/WatchPeopleDie. Sometime its good to get some perspective of just how quickly you can go from hero to 0 if you do stupid things. 

Lol. China has the largest population in the world. Don't claim to be that intelligent but I'm assuming they must have started giving birth at a faster rate than everywhere else? Can only have 2 kids per couple? Most of those kinds of videos are filmed in China. Forgive me for putting two and two together. I'm kind of joking. 

Back to the point. So I'm watching this movie, with English subs x3 or something so just rushing through it like kinda keeping up with whats going on I thought, but I'll be honest I'm not really watching it for the plot. 

Pretty sure it started off in High School, I was OK with that because assuming its on loads of legit porn sites and full on nudity and erotic sex scenes the actors are surely 18+. 

Half way through there's a particularly beautiful, sensual scene like you can tell the director loves this shit. Then, one of the girls is painting the other girl nude, obviously. fully nude and even clean shaven. Now I'm sure y'all can agree when you are watching movie as if it was a porn flick, the first proper pussy flash is a high point. 

Now before I even had time to attempt to thrust into this Fleshlight. I was watching 3-4 year olds running round a class room and on the yard. Like 30 of them. It went hardcore sex scene, fully nude pussy flash to children. That has never happened before. Obviously, there is no kids on legit streaming sites. In between sex scenes shes gone from going to school to being a teacher, which I apparently missed entirely. 

You have to understand that at this point I'm no longer flicking through vids I've fully committed to this movie. it's not like I just had a hand of my dick or I'm at the mouse. Ive got a towel down, loobed up fleshlight that I am inside and now I'm watching kids run around a playground. 

Don't know what y'all have done but I started to laugh at the situation. which obvs killed the mood. I can't laugh and jack off. I'm like Louis CK in the sense that when I masturbate I have to feel disgusted in myself like I'm fully aware how soul destroying this is and should not be doing it but like what you gonna do be a monk? (Less in the creep kinda way)

By this point I've stopped, got the mouse and just started skipping through the scenes to see what happens and yeah it goes from erotic sex scenes to kids in school a second time. Suppose it is just a movie about life humans have sex, then go teach kids and it's not actually porn but like, 

Isn't that a bit weird? I'm sorry but I don't want a class of school kids surprising me when I'm jacking off. What was the director or whatever thinking!? I suppose they didn't want people masturbating to the movie but the sex scenes are on porn sites they are that erotic!

So 1. Is it weird? 2. Anyone been in a similar situation with Blue is the warmest colour? Like I don't know about you but I've watched a lot of porn and erotic movies but it's never cut to school kids before. 

Sidenote, at this point I'm going with Blue being the warmest colour as in Blue which represent women in Gnosticism because it's clearly a lesbian flick. Can anyone tell me I'm wrong and suggest a simpler reason its called that? 

And for the record 2 hours and 10 minutes in, the relationship turns to shit. Obviously. It was going so well and then one person just woke up and thought. ""You know what, I am sick of you.""

So...yeh...

6,I am NOT jumping ship. I think we are at peak manipulation and it won't get much worse. There is still value here.,"Yes, the manipulation is unbelievably pervasive and sophisticated, but there is still value here. 

The technology of reddit simply does not enable a remedy as far as I know, but the manipulation seems to have reached a peak in the last few weeks, and I will explain why I don't think it can get any worse. In fact, I have noticed a slight decrease in the obvious behaviors such as blatant derailing of productive conversation (thanks to mods I suspect), and a big increase in super sophisticated manipulation that I think 99% (probably even mods) don't see yet.

That implies that the goal of [the players](http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/) is to keep 99% (600,000) around so that they can condition us; whereas, they would indeed like for anyone to leave who is calling out their best moves, or who is a threat to their most sacred plays, such as [The Illusion Of Legitimacy](http://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/).

The new and more sophisticated manipulation seems to be the peak of what is possible. 

For example, certain posts that would have gotten 70-90% up votes just 3 months ago, and which start out getting 100% up votes for the first few votes, are now being taken to about 50% and zero votes after the first few minutes and are held there for the first few hours until they have been neutralized, and then they are usually allowed to float more freely after that. This requires a 1-to-1 counter vote for each up vote as they come in, which thus looks pretty natural; whereas, if they can do that, then they could just as easily have sent the post to 10% and kept it there, but that would have be too obvious and thus counter productive.

If there is similar or greater value somewhere else please let me know. The only other place where I have found sufficient value is ZeroHedge, and since I started using reddit in December, I have been on reddit (primarily r/conspiracy) a lot more than ZeroHedge.",conspiracy,1521990624,JimAtEOI,119,391,True,2018-03-25

YouTube has plenty of this information, even in the height of their censorship. You all bicker about recent shootings, meanwhile the agenda to get Americans to beg for their guns to be taken away has been on the CIA agenda for decades. The truth about our reality is right under your noses, but your mind wont let you entertain the possibilities. The real revolution won't be televised. The real revolution starts with healing yourself, preventing the further poisoning of your body, developing technology that will free society from the energy cartels. We manifest reality, and we have the power to change reality around us as we know it. Collective consciousness is the ultimate tool, and when you've convinced the masses that they aren't responsible for the manifesting of reality, you get to take the reigns. It's an ongoing battle and it's won one opened mind at a time. R/conspiracy is a dead end for the opening of the mind folks.

17,Is WW3 going to be the Petro-Dollar vs the Petro-Yuan?,"A month ago there was an article in the WSJ's that discussed the US military was going to be shifting there focus from the Middle East to China &amp; Russia.

&gt;[U.S. Considers Boosting Asia Forces With Special Marine Units
Shift would promote new strategy emphasizing China and Russia, with cutbacks in the Mideast](http://archive.is/vSlrd#selection-1989.0-1993.91)

It continues on to say:

&gt;Military officials said the MEUs are under consideration with other complementary proposals to reposition forces into East Asia to counter a rising China, which the new defense strategy identifies as **undermining an international world order in place for decades**. Officials said they didn’t know when a final decision would be made about deployments.

Initially I figured they were talking about the NWO in general, but yesterday I discovered [China is about to start their own Petro-Yuan that will compete against the Petro Dollar](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-futures/china-plans-to-launch-crude-oil-futures-on-march-26-securities-regulator-idUSKBN1FT0P2) and it launches tomorrow.  China is the largest purchaser of oil and will most likely be working with Russian, Syria &amp; Iran.  Not only that, but they are backing the [Petro Yuan with Gold](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/petro-yuan-china-wants-to-dethrone-dollar-rmb-denominated-oil-contracts.html), which both [Russia &amp; China](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-china-and-russia-are-buying-so-much-gold-2016-08-01) have been hoarding for the past decade +.

This is in light of the US have a bloated military budget and recently having Neocon Bolton take the National Security Advisor position.

32,The golden age of the internet is coming to an end. The future is frightening.,"The invention of the internet was one of the most important leaps forward in human history.  The closest historical parallel one can draw, is the invention of the printing press.  In the historical blink of an eye, unlimited information and instantaneous global communication was put at our fingertips.  

The first major signs of the impact on political protests came in the run-up to invasion of Iraq.  The anti-war movement was able to coordinate internationally, and consequently mobilized the largest mass demonstration in human history, with rallies taking place all over the world.  But these were merely the first tremors of the earthquakes that were to come.  By the time the Arab spring broke out, the situation changed dramatically.  Now, even in the ex-colonial world, ordinary people had mobile connections.  The masses could mobilize and coordinate, even without organizations, even without leadership structures, using devices they could carry in their own hands.  Globally, the ruling class was stunned.  Strong dictatorships that stood for decades melted in the fires of revolution.  

Now, a clear and conscious effort is underway to disarm the masses.  The internet is changing.  Social media has changed from an outreach-tool to an echo-chamber.  Net neutrality is being attacked and dismantled.  Our cell phones have become spy networks for corporations and intelligence agencies.  Search engines sensor results.  And your shopping list now stalks you online as ads for anything you briefly feign interest in clog up your browser. 

George Orwell predicted exactly this, but he never could have imagined that we would knowingly and willingly carry these spy-devices around with us.

Simple as that, maybe a better fence too. You don't have the sheperds stand in the field with guns. They are sheperds. That would be disruptive and counterproductive.**

Students are our future. They are America's greatest natural resource. They deserve to be in an environment where they feel safe, not an environment where they are forced to wear prison backpacks and are subjected to prison-style policies. **That is the best way to ensure future shootings occur**

That said, you can't just have any old rent-a-cop with a gun or local PD do it. That will not be effective and that will not give students the sense of security they need. 

It should be an honor to protect HS students. So what if they are ungrateful and disrespectful. There is also immense hope, creative energy, and visions of unlimited potential there. There's also a lot of fun.

**Solution:**

Create a program in which the best and the brightest from military academies and ROTC volunteer to do 1-2 years as armed security in high risk schools. I'm talking West Point, Coast Guard Academy, Air Force Academy, Naval Academy. The cream of the crop. 


Teach for America and Peace Corps consistently attract some of the top talent from the best universities in the US. Why can't this be the same?


To make it effective, participants would undergo incredibly intense psychological and tactical training on par with the seals and other elite groups. In addition they would also do meditation. If they pass, they are accepted into the program and are placed into a school with the best tech in communications, surveillance, and threat deterrence, as well as a whole range of non-lethal equipment. They would not answer to the PD, teachers, or administrators, but they would only be allowed in the school if the community passes a vote. 

Peace Corps can only go to countries where they have been invited by the governments there. School funding is decided by local elections via school levies. This should be the same. It's not mandatory, but it would be funded by the national government, maybe local governments pay a % of the cost. 

As volunteers would be smart and extremely well-trained, people would look at them and rest easy, not worry.  


To make these positions attractive, in addition to the training, participation in this program would fast-track their career advancement and get immediate pay benefits relative to their peers who did not participate. This seems fair and equitable. 


Our children need to have a sense of security in order to learn. This would provide that, and so many other benefits to volunteers and the community.


What does everyone think? 


There will always be wolves. Declawing them and making them wear clear backpacks is not going to stop them from killing again. I believe this to be a workable solution.

63,Debunking the myth/propaganda I keep seeing about the Cloud Act. The truth is it does requires a warrant.,"This is the real debate about the cloud act.

&gt; In oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday, Microsoft argued that the federal government is not authorized to demand emails, tied to a criminal investigation, that are stored in an overseas datacenter. Finding those emails and migrating them to the U.S., Microsoft says, would effectively allow the government to **apply a warrant extraterritorially,** which is beyond its power. https://www.geekwire.com/2018/microsoft-met-skepticism-supreme-court-justices-overseas-data-case/

So to summarize, the cloud act **does require a warrant** the debate is if the warrant has jurisdiction over data stored on a cloud that physically exists overseas. 

So why have people been turned against this? Well it does hurt criminals who store the data of their crimes on overseas clouds. That sounds like something corrupt politicians with sealed indictments would be afraid of.

125,Who Murdered The Notorious B.I.G (Cristopher Wallace),"Okay, the murder of Biggie has stumped me. All the suspects and possible motives that lead to several possible killers has confused me. I've spent time collecting evidence on the topic and came up with the most likely situation. 
-It is obvious that the killing was well planned, the shooter would have to have known which car Biggie was in and which seat. This would have relied on constant communication between the killer and a possible 'spotter'; watching biggies every move. The more the planning, the higher the motive is likely to be. This pretty much rules out a gang hit as Biggie reportedly owed the Crips a large amount of money.
- Witnesses reported hearing police radios towards the exit of the Peterson Automobile Museum. 4 black muslims wearing black suits and bowties. The shooter was also reported as being black muslim wearing a black suit and a bowtie. 
- A 'dirty' cop named David Mack had used radios and meticulous planning to steal $772,000 from a bank. He is rumoured to be part of the shooting. 
- When detectives went to Mack's house after the bank robbery, the found a shrine to Tupac Shakur in his garage. Bearing in mind that police uncovered that David Mack was on Death Row Record's (a rival to Biggie, also Tupac's label) payroll. 
- Also, detectives found five 9mm handguns, the gun used to murder Biggie, and a cabinet full of ammo of foreign origin. The brand used to kill Biggie was 'Geco', which is very rarely used in the US. This ammunition was found in Mack's house. 
- A key eyewitness, Damien Butler, was sat right behind Biggie when he was killed. He picked Mack's photo out of a lineup and said he saw him at the carport and when they went in and out of the Peterson Automobile Museum. 

We now have a eyewitness recount placing Mack at the scene, near where police radios were heard. Another big clue was the shooter possibly had a middle-eastern name, possible 'Amir'. When detectives looked at the people who had visited Mack in jail, they found a record off a guy named 'Amir Muhammed' visiting him. It turns out Muhammed had left a false social security number and address on the visitor form, further raising suspicions. They found 7-8 previous addresses, all of which no good. When Detective Poole of the LAPD wanted to follow this lead up, his superiors denied him. They knew it was going to lead to a cop. This is just like the Rampart scandal, and example of the LAPD refusing to follow leads that led to a cop. By this point, the detectives had no doubt enough evidence to warrant the following up of Mack, but it was never done. Another point would be that the credibility of Poole's evidence can more or less be confirmed. XXL magazine spoke to former bosses, DAs, attorneys etc. All of which said he is to be trusted. 

In most gangland killings, there is no evidence. However there was a minimum of 2 witnesses that produced a composite drawing that closely resembles Amir Muhammed. I don't know how to insert an image so if you type 'Composite drawing of biggies killer' it is there.

This evidence took a long time to compile, feel free to leave your theories in the comments.

EDIT
Here is the image of the main suspect of the murder based on my evidence, his name is Amir Muhammad with the alias of Harry Billups.

In the last couple of years I have definitely seen this from being a neat gadget some people have to being pushed everywhere. I swear, I see an ad for them every day, and I don't even watch TV at home!

Of course part of the reason is the technological advancements in the smart home. As of January 2018, [one in six Americans owns a smart speaker](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/577007267/jan-2018-smart-audio-report). And [95% of Americans own a smartphone](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/). That's not necessarily bad; I love my smartphone, I use it for work, Reddit, videos, books... It's a wonderful device that makes my life easier and better. I got a smart speaker during Christmas, and I liked it so much (it's like having Google in your living room!) that I gave one to my family. They loved it, too.

I really didn't think that much about it until I saw an ad for a (Ring floodlight)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a57j9WXWm0c] on TV. Pretty nifty for catching snoopers and finding out whether its raccoons or bears rattling in the trash cans! I can literally watch my house from anywhere in the globe, from my phone!

Wait a minute.

If I can do that, **anyone that has access to the Internet can, too.**

I don't mean just the government. [Of course the government can hack into your phone and into your Smart Home](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/), we know this. [Hackers have a field day with them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2017/09/19/this-company-staged-a-hack-with-multiple-devices-to-show-your-homes-vulnerablity/#6393404c5322), too. Basically, by having all these devices, we are making it easier for anybody with decent technical capabilities to not just eavesdrop, but to *get a live feed of our properties*. And that's assuming there's electronic protection measures in place. More often than not, there aren't. When you gift your grandmother a Ring, or an Alexa, they are at the mercy of the Internet. And we know because [this has happened before](https://gizmodo.com/a-creepy-website-is-streaming-from-73-000-private-secur-1655653510).

There is a push towards further encroachment of privacy in easy-to-hack devices, due to convenience, ""safety"", being up-to-date in tech... And there are many agents that will benefit from such push. The tech goliaths love it, the Governments love it, and we embrace it with open arms.

I'm not saying the government is listening through your phone, or that a gang of Ukrainian hackers are watching through your cameras.

1. Warren Flood’s name gave away the use of a computer by a DNC insider/contractor.
2. Consistent negative press outcome and false attributions to Wikileaks on key dates gave us clues of an intent to undermine Wikileaks.
3. Fabricated “Russian Fingerprints” exposed fakeness of Russian hacker persona and suggested the effort to attribute to Wikileaks was to preemptively discredit the leaks they would later publish..
4. Your use of “told”, “tell”, “say”, “said”, definite/indefinite article use and command of prepositions expose you as being someone that natively speaks in English as does the terminology and phrasing you had used in much of your informal communications – it also helped that Dmitri’s advice was followed with very little consistency.
5. Specious claims about hackers still being on the network as of 11th June after installing Falcon across the DNC network exposed the nature of the WAPO article (propaganda piece driven by CrowdStrike/DNC statements) from June 14th and made it obvious that excuses were being made for emails being dated as late as May so that the leaks could be attributed to hacking. (So, Henry/Alperovitch probably found the leak source between 12th-14th of June)
6. The fact there was a month delay before mentioning the “Trump Opposition Research” being targeted and that it wasn’t mentioned until after Assange announced the HRC-related leaks were coming.
7. The fact there’s no evidence to support your claims about that file being targeted and the fact it’s unlikely you’d know it was targeted if you couldn’t even say who targeted it or exactly when. – It suggests there’s an alternate reason for mentioning that file’s description – one possibility being a switch or ‘transfer’ device to give credibility to whoever might appear soon afterwards presenting that very same document.
8. Guccifer 2.0 turning up the next day, using that document (a tainted copy of the one originally authored by Lauren Dillon) as his first document to release AND used it as a lure to suck in all the gullible press – as if the whole thing was planned.
9. The fact you fooled giants in the cyber-security industry as well as various intelligence agencies suggests that G2 was really someone (or some people) that were really aligned with either HRC or the DNC and had both cyber-security and counter-intelligence skills. The comprehensive masquerade I dismantled also supports this notion.
10. Your efforts to poison-the-well with Seth are obvious when the fake fingerprint clue is considered from the start.
11. The fact your hacker persona’s breach claims were never independently verifiable (and quite a few got debunked) shows you were not a real hacker, you were getting the files because you were being given access to them (this also explains why you could only get DNC files despite your tall tales about being an amazing hacker using zero-day ‘sploits).
12. The DNC’s rejection of FBI offers to help (when they directly have the tools of the state, etc. to aide in identifying and tracking a hacker down) gives good reason to suspect that things were not as they reported.
13. The fact Falcon was installed on the DNC’s network yet CrowdStrike did not produce details pertaining to the actual exfiltration of email data and instead posted APT-group identifiers without context.
14. Guccifer 2.0 appears to have had physical LAN access when collating certain files. (Yup, not published yet but I promise you that it’s coming).
Good game Shawn.

Every other year, Obama makes big donations to Planned Parenthood and brags about it on his twitter account:

* [2013: $1,188,442](https://i.imgur.com/wqlePLt.jpg)
* [2015: $981,152](https://i.imgur.com/jwmfjtu.png)
* [2017: $1,085,100](https://i.imgur.com/3bSTX4D.jpg)


I always thought it was weird that he gave such specific amounts, but I never knew where the money came from. Until now. 

Here's how much the NRA donates to political campaigns each year, according to OpenSecrets:

* [2012: $1,188,442](https://i.imgur.com/FM9sh6n.jpg)
* [2014: $981,152](https://i.imgur.com/ICI8BOr.jpg)
* [2016: $1,085,100](https://i.imgur.com/n3rkquL.jpg)

So every year after the NRA's donation totals are announced, **Obama donates the EXACT SAME amount to Planned Parenthood.**

Is he trolling us? Why is he doing this? Is PP funneling money to Every Town on his behalf? 

I don't have answers, but as an NRA member I feel very conflicted. I want to keep donating but I **don't** want any money to go to Planned Parenthood. I might stop giving, I don't know. I'm very spooked right now. Does anyone have any ideas?

HOWEVER, I just (unfortunately) watched Stormy's interview on 60 Minutes. Her pupils - especially for the harsh studio lighting they used to make her look good - were huge. Absolutely, abnormally so.

She wasn't squinting.

This could be the results of habitual amphetamine or cocaine use, but just another thought...

Syphilis.

174,Ive created a working revolution,"To learn everything you need to know about our human condition as the 99% go on this Instagram account: Woke_revolution and join the taking back of our true freedom. 

Our government and corporate entities our enslaving the majority of our race and holding back our potential as a people to a great measure. Its not about working jobs, its about who we are working for. And i am telling you right now we are working for very corrupt and wealthy individuals, who only care for themselves and their interests, and not the people. If the government had been working for the people and our planet climate change and world hunger would be long gone out the window. But instead we are still enduring these crimes against humanity, and our potential. No government, and no elected leaders are on your side, and it is obvious. Just look at the current state of our world. Division, hatred, people being uneducated, wars, corporate and government corruption. And that just starts the list of whats wrong in our world. We have been fed lies and we are distracted every day to keep us unable to see through to how corrupt and twisted the world really is. The media isnt focusing on whats important. And the people are blind to this. Theyve just been 
taught to go to shool, get a job, work, have a family, consume, then just die. People dont know what we as a race are really capable accomplishing because because we have only had corrupt, non ambitious, unfaithful and uncaring leaders. All across the world. None of the leaders care for the people, and same as the governments. They only care to keep us trapped within this self destructive system which has been designed to destroy us. At this point that is whats happening. If fwe rise up as a people and take back our power and our lives. We can be free. We can know what it means to really be free. Until we destroy the governments hold on ourselves as a people, we wont know freedom. If we run the revolution we can solve famine and climate change in months. Yes. Together once we work with eachother and are united. We can work very fast. And accomplish great goals quite easily. Because we as a people are doing these things. Which has never happend before, it was always the sly governments and corrupt corporate heads that run the show and what and where the world goes. Liturally they benefited off keeping us down, oppressed, and enslaved. And did so very effectively cus this has been going on for years by badly selected leaders. So the people largely just have no idea. 

Our potential as a human species is undiscovered. Because we dont even know our own capabilities yet. This means once we come together and take our power back. Adding to or taking over the goverment. We can do so much good, we dont even know yet. Because we have the RIGHT! People in charge. As the revolution. We can stop all wars, have goals and specific interests that we as a race can accomplish and achieve together, stop famine in months, climate change likewise, poverty, and any suffering. We can stop all that, And do much more to build our race and earth. We are working for the enemy, the people trying to keep us working for them so they and few bastards gain greatly. We need to work for the revolution and take back/ change and transform the world for the fate of the human race!! 

We need to unite and break free, as a people, from the corporate and government grasp and do things ourselves. Or else our potential will be lost, and we will life in this horrible cycle of corrupted death. 

This was a great a real way of putting things, and find out more on Instagram: Woke_revolution

I understand why because of what was/is happening in r/politics and r/news. I like hearing opposing views but a lot of them have not been constructive. I see shit talking about feminism getting up voted. Okay cool, but constructively say why.

I'm just wondering what the demographic has become... I miss the pre election subreddit for a lot of the reasons folks have been saying.

232,Is Brigading the same as Book Burning?,"Brigading doesn’t seem to be much different than burning books, just seems more immediate. 

For those who need a little refresher, book burning is the ritual destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of censorship and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question.

In some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to cultural heritage. Examples include the burning of books and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty (213–210 BCE), the burning of the Library of Alexandria (c. 49), the obliteration of the Library of Baghdad (1258), the destruction of Aztec codices by Itzcoatl (1430s), and the burning of Maya codices on the order of bishop Diego de Landa (1562).

In other cases, such as the Nazi book burnings, other copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence an aspect of a nation's culture.

* Be happy for what you have, be optimistic, be overall positive

* Be miserable about the fact that just about everything is wrong

I'm not here to tell you which one to choose. I'm here to tell you that they're both fucked up in their own ways.

You could be happy about your life. You're not in severe poverty, you can at least afford the luxury that allows you to read this post, you're probably eating enough to live semi-comfortably. I could go on and on about how the world is a good place, because, depending on how you look at it, the world is beautiful. 

There are things in this world that can make you feel serene. This world has the power to enable somebody to go outside and breathe and forget about all of the problems within itself. You could achieve true serenity in a world that is, in some's eyes, far from broken.

On the other hand, there are people that believe the world is quickly approaching the end of its lifetime. There are the people that believe there is nothing good in the world and everything sucks. Some people believe that humans are polluting the world faster than ever before, and that we are the cause of 'climate change' or 'global warming.' 

They also say that our government is the worst in the world and they are the most corrupt people ever. Or, maybe they're not even people at all. 

I have the blessing of being on the fence. I believe various points from either side. I believe that the world can be an awful place, our government is bad, etc. but I also believe that you can achieve peace on this planet. You can comfortably and happily live in a world that is riddled with unpleasantness. 

The issue is conformity. You conform with the public and most will choose the typical lifestyle. Go to school, get a degree, get a job making money, marry, have a kid or two, get them to a good school, and the cycle continues. 

The truth that everybody refuses to believe is that you can live without money. You can live without a degree from college. It's possible, it's just not *convenient*. It's not convenient for people to hunt for their own food. It's not convenient for people to build their own house. It's not convenient for people to entertain themselves without Candy Crush, Words With Friends, Xbox, PlayStation, etc.

But in my earlier years i was living with all kinds of people, our appartment was always full of friends from many different races. We lived quite happily.

At school in Paris my best friends were Bulgarian, Hungarian, Yugoslavian... but i had friends of all races, black, chinese, Arabian etc.
I never knew what racism was, i could not understand the concept.

But after i quit Paris i have lived my teenage years in french small towns where racism and intolerance where quite ""normal"" for many people (absolutely not ALL people, of course, but a good part). 

I have never been a victim of racist insults myself since nobody knew i was half turkish. It was even not clear for me. I really felt 100% french. I have a french name, i have the whiter skin one can have, never mentioned my family to people, i am not muslim, don't speak turkish, have no relations with my turkish family etc.

So many people believed i was a normal french and constantly talk all kinds of racist jokes and thoughts in front of me as if i was in the obligation to agree and laugh at it with them.
It was an embarrassing situation because i really didn't knew who i was finally, i had no real identity. So i could not criticize these people and say to them i was myself a foreign boy, it seemed useless to me. 
I loved these people anyway, they were my friends.

With time, i even began to accept some racist thoughts. I became inconsciously in a rebellion towards my father's family and the lack of love from them. I felt alone and devoid of identity so i chose to assume i was pure french. It gave me a reason to say i was somebody, with a past and an identity to be proud of.

With some friends we began to play with all kinds of racist imagery (nazism, svastikas, FN (french national front) etc. ). We were not really involved in it, it was kind of child play for us, but we loved the rebel aura it could give and were fascinated. We were unconscious, we only wanted to seem rebel even if we were just ridiculous. 
It was a complete non-sense since in the same time we were huge fans of rap music and cinema and all our idols were black or jews.

You have to know though that these things could not exist today for french teenagers, it could be totally banned. Me and my friends were allowed to think what we wanted quite freely because it was another time and this time does not exist anymore in our society.

Anyway, what could describe correctly my behaviour is that i was very cynical, hater, violent and negative. I was a loser but wanted to be a king. The Alpha guys laughed at me and I was always in rage.

I was constantly insulting, hating, fighting, laughing at people etc.

I never had a girlfriend because when sometimes a sweet girl came to me and wanted to be my friend i refused because i liked to have some sadistic power over her with my rejection. The only girls i liked were inaccessible for me and i was treated like a shit by her but i stayed in this pathetic situation.

If I only knew more about Life and Love at this time i would have been happy with the lovely girls who really liked me, even if they were not necessary attractive to me, rather than dreaming about girls who never said ""hello"" to me... 

By the way, a guy should always accept the love of any girl without discrimination. Rejecting girls because they are not what we expect physically or other reasons brings curses. If a girl loves you you have to accept this marvelous gift of Life and learn to love her as she is a Godess. At least accept just friendship with her but never reject her demand. 
Only the guys who do that will know what Love and joy really means in this life. 
But it is another story...

So I was systematically against what the majority liked and did and always hating society.

But weird things happened for me. The strangest thing i noticed (but without being able to find a link between that and my bad thoughts) is that i began progressively plagued by a skin disease called psoriasis.

Psoriasis is literally a condition where the skin is in a self-destructive process. Interestingly, it seems that my problems of identity and my constant hate towards almost evedybody surfaced with this disease. 

I had many other problems at this time who could have play a part in this disease (especially i always had bad crises of psoriasis anytime i could not express myself in society and felt rejected or unable to find my place).

I think that my involvement for a year at this time with the J. Witnesses was one of the causes too because it gave me many bad feelings and frustrations, a very bad and depressing experience. I became intolerant about almost anything and began more and more shy and sad.

I also had many problems of hate with my neighbours at that time and it was horrible.

After my teenage years i stopped all involvement with extremist ideologies but i was still negative in many ways. 

Fortunately, I had the chance one day to find the books of an author called Joseph Murphy about the power or forgiveness and Love.
I was very reluctant in the beginning but it allowed me to understand how insanely I was a selfish egoistic hater who refused to love and forgive people.

I don't caution all the things Murphy wrote (maybe too much religious stuff, I don't really think that the Bible talks with allegories about the subconscious mind, by example...), i think he made many mistakes, but about Love and Forgiveness he was absolutely right. It was the revelation I needed for changing my life. Before that i never have been able to understand what was so wrong with me. I thought i was normal and never admitted my own folly. 

So I decided to change, to work on my hate and my relational problems and I have finally dedicated more than 10 years working spiritually, searching and studying all kinds of methods and traditions for cleaning my mind of all the negativity. Prayers seemed good but not enough. 

My only wish and obsession has been to discover how to really love and heal humanity like maybe a great master like Jesus did.And even if it seems crazy i will never be satisfied until i find this. I know that finding this secret is the reason why i am here on this planet and I will never give up my quest. Maybe i will never win but i am here to try and try without stopping. Even if it is useless, like chasing a rainbow, i will still believe. I will keep this dream alive.

Anyway, it would be too long to write all the details about my life and i already wrote too much.

Just know that the last ten years have been full of a strange fight between evolution and love feelings and bad relapses into my old thought patterns, hate etc.

The point is that i have finally discovered physically and spiritualy that any kind of racism and hate towards human beings can ruin health. It is a poison. And the worst kind for the mind.

I understood that definitively some years ago because i became strangely more and more sensitive to the slightest bad thought about people. 

At a time, I was reading political things and had some interest for the NWO theories on the internet. You know in France we have some very negative guys like Soral and Dieudonné who are considered by their supporters as politically subversive, some kinds of ""heros"". Antisemitism is rampant in their speeches. They are not against the theory that the Shoa never existed and was an hoax made up by the Jews, by example.

I have read many things about this kind of ideology but, believe it or not, anytime i began to accept these racist and negative thoughts i ended finally sick. I mean physically and awfully sick.

I had headaches, nausea, sometimes to the point of vomiting, stomach pains, bad sleep, distress and anxiety. And basically many bad things happened in my life. All seemed to turn negative.

It was especially true when i talked or thought bad things about the jewish community. Anytime i had an antisemitism feeling i was soon sick for days. It was like a punishment. Anytime i had again some sympathy for nazism, FN or other negative ideology and political views, i was sick too. 

In the beginning it was principally the bad thoughts about the jews who made me sick the most. In fact, i felt so horrible and had to regret so much that i had to ask Heaven for forgiveness or something. Only when i confessed my mistake and loved the jews again i could recover from my ilnesses.

Basically i never had a decent reason to hate jews, because i just don't know them. I never knew personally any jew except maybe a doctor in Paris when I was a child. And he was a good doctor, by the way. My mum used to work with many jews in Paris because she was in the textile industry. She always said to me that the jews were very good and nice people so she never understood why i was sometimes very racist against them when we talked about that. 

In fact all the bad feelings i sometimes had towards tem came only out of false informations and theories on the internet and antisemitic propaganda. It was not my own experience and my own thoughts. It was only based on fear and jealousy towards people i even don't know, just because some bad and sad persons talked and wrote about all the reasons they have to hate them and how everybody has to rebel against the jewish plan to rule the world etc.

I feel so bad now for all those men who live their life in the obsessive hate of the jews... It is pathetic. All those individuals are juste destroying their health for nothing and they have such negative influence on other people who believe them...

All these theories and antisemitic propaganda are like a virus in the mind and it made me sick. I was not myself when i accepted such crappy things.

The ""funny"" thing though is that many people who hate the jews talk a lot about the so called ""jewish nose""... They don't seem to understand that millions of non jews have this kind of nose, myself by example... So those fools blinded by their hate who believe that a jew can be recognisable by his nose would maybe throw me in concentration camp if they see me, believing i am a jew, and they would be completely wrong...

Anyway, my sickness phenomenon was not just working with antisemitism.

I began soon to notice that even when i had racist thoughts about black people, the gypsies or any foreign people i ended sick too... No matter what race or community, it works anytime. Hating people made me sick, sad and lost.

The sickness did not manifest just after some thoughts, of course, but if i spent maybe some hours, or a day or two in such a negative state it happened.

Personally I used to like black people but the only reason i sometimes had racist thoughts about them is by jealousy. Black guys tend to be seen by girls as good lovers, and especially many blonde white girls date black guys. 

You can be sure that when white men are racist against black men the source of the hate is that they feel black men as competitors. They fear that the white women will prefer to be with black men.
It is a serious anxiety and sad feeling and i know so many men who feel like that... 

Personally, i had a traumatizing experience as a teenager. I had a neighbour in the flat above mine, a celibate mother of two children, white blonde with glasses, bourgeoise... One night the children were out, don't know where, and she came back with a black guy she probably found in a nightclub, a party or something...

So you know what i mean for the rest of the story... I heard them make their thing and i was in rage. I had so many bad thoughts, i hated all the world.I started to have this feeling about the fact that white women could prefer black men and i was sad.
Not that the sounds where spectacular, you know, she was not really screaming and the bed was not on the verge to crack, but i was upset and jealous anyway.

So the only reason for me and many white guys to be sometimes racist against black men or to fear them is jealousy and lack of self confidence with women and nothing more. I think you could hardly find a white guy who hate the black and who is not secretly afraid that white women go with them.

This is not really a dick size matter since so many white guys have big dicks (not me though but it's another story..) but rather an unconscious fear of being rejected by women if for a reason or another they will prefer a black man. This is really irrational and stupid  finally. But this feeling hurts a lot and is the cause of so much hate and conflicts... 

Anyway, concerning the link between hate and sickness I had so many times the occasion to check this phenomenon again and again that there is no more the slightest doubt in my mind : hating people act as a poison in the body. 

It starts in the mind but soon the body is disturbed and sickness can manifest.

Why ? Because racism is pure hate and hate is the ultimate poison. It goes against all the laws of Life and nothing good can result of such a wrong use of the spirit and energy.

I advise all people who are racists and haters to try to heal their soul and give up their bad feelings. Please stop poisoning yourself with hate. Free your mind and be happy. Rediscover your state of innocence.

Try to understand that the other people are like yourself. As physical beings here we all came from semen and woman womb and pleasure, ecstasy and Love are the only source of our lives. 

Matter and spirit take many forms according to many circumstances but to feel a fundamental difference between us and others is an illusion because we are all like one soul in an infinite play of individualities. If it was not the case it would be impossible to experiment life as a relational and social thing. Nobody could understand each other but we all know that there is a universal language of the soul beyond races, cultures and words so all humans can recognise the same source in everybody. 

According to this fact racism is a non sense. It's taking appearances and circumstances as the soul and source. It's missing the point of who people really are. It's to have very limited feelings, intelligence and emotions. It's to live a very limited life. It's to potentially ruin our own health and hurting others for nothing worthy.

We are not necessarely in the obligation to love everybody if it seems too hard for us but at least we have the obligation to try to never hate.

I know how hard it is. Hardest challenge in the world. No doubt. Maybe impossible sometimes. But we have to give it a try.

Even if we don't do it for others we have to do it for ourselves because avoiding useless hate and racism will keep us in better health and mood. We will have benefits. 

So please, give it a try just for one day,or even just for an hour... Try to forgive everybody, try to forget your hate, imagine all people as your friends and feel what it is to live in a world without enemies to fight everywhere. 

Relaxing and sweet isn't ?

Now to continue or not such a marvelous state of being is up to us. Everyday we have to chose between hate and love. We chose. it's up to us.

Thanks.

274,La Parguera military base,"Anyone have any info on the military base in La Parguera, Puerto Rico? I'm working down here for hurricane relief effort and have read about multiple UFO sightings and crash sights. I have asked locals about it and the most interesting story I've came across is when I did a kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay in La Parguera from the guide. He was hesitant at first to tell me about his experience but after poking at him for a while he spilled the beans. He said that him and buddy were scuba diving around what is known as secret military base for submarines when part of the coral wall opened up. He said once it opened there was a lot of turbulence and pressure fluncation that caused them to pass out underwater. He said he returned to consciousness underwater and rised to the surface but was not able to find his buddy. When he went to tell the mother of his friend she said he was taken to a hyberbaric chamber in the states which he thought was weird since they have one in Puerto Rico as well. When his friend returned, he said he didn't even remember going on the scuba trip. The tour guide also said he went exploring behind the base and came across lake that while he was there, the water level rose 7 ft in a matter of minutes and then back down. He proposed that the lake is there to displace the water for when the wall opens as to not create a tidal wave and draw attention. His story seemed legit and left me with an eerie feeling. I tried doing some research on the base and can literally find nothing. I know this isn't necessarily a conspiracy but im curious if anyone has a link or any knowledge of the base and what's going on there. ",conspiracy,1522077023,Poopernikle,15,21,True,2018-03-26

* Why are we being told by other people what we want?

* Why are we being forced by other people to ""do what's best for us""?

Why is it that Donald J. Trump, a human being (haha he's a reptilian overlord. Hilarious) is treated any differently than you are. You are walking down the street next to him, but people will ignore your existence and praise him. You could be home from serving in Iraq, serving your country, protecting him and the people around you, but he will get all the credit.

Why is it, that in this free country of ours (Americans), there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of security cameras throughout the land? Why are we constantly monitored? It's so *we the people* do not do anything to threaten TPTB.

Why is there a law against just about everything in this *free* country of ours?

281,The Fifteen Miracles of 9/11,"1. The Twin Towers and WTC 7 were the only steel-framed high-rise buildings ever to come down without explosives or incendiaries.

2. The Twin Towers, each of which had 287 steel columns, were brought down solely by a combination of airplane strikes and jet-fuel fires.

3. WTC 7 was not even hit by a plane, so it was the first steel-framed high-rise to be brought down solely by ordinary building fires.

4. These World Trade Center buildings also came down in free fall – the Twin Towers in virtual free fall, WTC 7 in absolute free fall – for over two seconds.

5. Although the collapses of the of the WTC buildings were not aided by explosives, the collapses imitated the kinds of implosions that can be induced only by demolition companies.

6. In the case of WTC 7, the structure came down symmetrically (straight down, with an almost perfectly horizontal roofline), which meant that all 82 of the steel support columns had to fall simultaneously, although the building’s fires had a very asymmetrical pattern.

7. The South Tower’s upper 30-floor block changed its angular momentum in midair.

8. This 30 floor block then disintegrated in midair.

9. With regard to the North Tower, some of its steel columns were ejected out horizontally for at least 500 feet.

10. The fires in the debris from the WTC buildings could not be extinguished for many months.

11. Although the WTC fires, based on ordinary building fires, could not have produced temperatures above 1,800℉, the fires inexplicably melted metals with much higher melting points, such as iron (2,800℉) and even molybdenum (4,753℉).

12. Some of the steel in the debris had been sulfidized, resulting in Swiss-cheese-appearing steel, even though ordinary building fires could not have resulted in the sulfidation.

13. As a passenger on AA Flight 77, Barbara Olson called her husband, telling him about hijackers on her plane, even though this plane had no onboard phones and its altitude was too high for a cell phone call to get through.

14. Hijacker pilot Hani Hanjour could not possibly have flown the trajectory of AA 77 to strike Wedge 1 of the Pentagon, and yet he did.

15. Besides going through an unbelievable personal transformation, ringleader Mohamed Atta also underwent an impossible physical transformation.

These are sourced from David Ray Griffin's book, *Bush and Cheney: How They Ruined America and the World.*

Additional miracles:

16. The claim that the passports of the alleged hijackers Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi- said to be on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania- were found on the ground of the crash site, even though nothing else at the site suggested a giant airliner had crashed there. Nothing was visible because the plane, which descended at 580 miles per hour, buried itself deep into the ground. Nevertheless, both passports escaped at the last millisecond and fell to the ground.

17. The claim that the passport of the alleged hijacker Satam al-Sugami was found at the site of the WTC's North Tower, meaning that the passport escaped intact after the plane perished in a giant fireball. ",conspiracy,1522078189,Pube_of_Dionysus,265,508,True,2018-03-26

Should it? Does online digital manipulation exist on reddit? Whose behind it? Who are the agent provocateurs?

The way the people in top minds of Reddit talk about conspiracy theorists is so disgusting, so bigoted, unfunny, and so negative that they must address the core philosophy of their sub. If such a subreddit is solely about humor why are none of the jokes actually funny? If you look at every comment on that sub they are all very assholish. Is being an asshole funny? I beg to differ. You can clearly see how they react when the joke is turned around on them. Every comment I posted yesterday saying ""pheephee"" was reported for harassment. Yet they make fun of people all day. You don't like being called pheephee? Too bad. 

If there's sub is just about humor, why does their most active moderator also run a sub dedicated to media manipulation? Why does Phoenix call /r/digital_manipulation his quote-unquote homework? If their sub is just about the lol's then should they not be involved in humorous subreddits? And not subreddits dedicated to cataloging user information, media manipulation, and metadata on Reddit communities?

I can't believe you're afraid to debate a conspiracy theorist, someone you have repeatedly called a dumbass and insane.

324,The geopolitics and the money behind 9/11,"There are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don't understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government's claims are patently absurd. I'll resolve that for you.

On 9/11/91 Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order. Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. What could he be up to?

As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding.

Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep. Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton. Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc. You can educate yourself on those details.

This scandal goes mainstream around 1986. In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.'s treasury secretary. Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type.

One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich. Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time. Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion. He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda. Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections.

Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich's personal money laundering machine. This manifests ten years later. If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don't have any real settlement issues. There is one major exception however: Mogilevich's money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it's balances without a record. It's worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC.

So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? What were they used for? This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse. You'll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like The Money Plane in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. It's estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993.

In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene. He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. Next thing you know 9/11 happens. There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I'd like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts.

On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying ""Angel is next,"" angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* ""Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?"" Fleischer: ""Yes, I can. That's correct.""(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda.

So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays.

This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public.

With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won't be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example.

So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended)

So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.

328,"The reddit admins have been forced to step in after users on a hate-subreddit conspired to make fake screenshots, attempting to trick advertisers into believing their reddit ads were being shown next to objectionable material.","In a very strange turn of events earlier this week, the admins of reddit were forced to intervene on a hate subreddit after it was discovered the users thereof had [engaged in a conspiracy to doctor screenshots with the intention of ""shaming"" reddit into censoring, what the hate subreddit suggested to be, objectionable material](https://i.imgur.com/LxNNDJK.png). 

For admins to make a public post in that way, scolding that community for its behavior, is highly abnormal, as the usual practice would be for a modmail to be sent. In this way, it seems the administrators do not trust the mods of that community to contain or otherwise prevent briagding and manipulated content from being posted.

Perhaps it is no surprise then that the community in question is run by some of the same mods who have run a hate subreddit directed at /r/conspiracy for nearly a year at this point, often times using the very same tactics as described by the admins above. Not surprisingly, after poking the admin beehive, [the moderators of said hate subreddit have begun to receive site warnings in regards to their ongoing brigading directed at other communities on the site (most likely for attacking /r/conspiracy).](https://i.imgur.com/xEhEeZ2.png)

That these hate subreddits need to go to the lengths they do (brigading and creating fake screenshots) is a testament to their ideological barbarity and manipulative intentions. To that end, it should be interesting to see if the warnings issued by the admins to those hate subreddit moderators have the intended effect with regards to manipulation of content on this subreddit over the coming days and weeks.

354,"* The “Left” are scrambling down the rabbit hole unearthing the corruption behind Trumps Presidency. The “Right” have been thrown for a loop, tricked into supporting yet another establishment candidate.","&gt;&gt;“It’s not difficult to see how we’re quickly moving into a situation where virtually everyone will be open to rethinking the world.

&gt;&gt;Bad news for regimes and good news for revolutionaries eh?”


This is for any interested in the High Level Insider anon. 

^^ Is something the anon first said when we discovered they had Alts on Reddit. I didn’t really understand the significance at the time. This was just after the election and it was difficult to see how the “Right” were doing anything other than basking in their victory. “The Left” weren’t doing much more than casting aspersions on his  unbecoming conduct and inexperience. 
Fast forward 1 year. Enough policies have been passed for everyone to see Trumps more of the same. Military spending increased $54B. Cabinet filled with Goldman Sachs and SkullnCrossbones. Unwavering support for Israel. Cambridge Analytica &amp; Facebook.

Trump provides a nexus point into conspiracy research that other presidents simply cannot match. Short of Bill Clinton and his chequered past as Arkansas Governor (Major cocaine trafficking interspersed with sanctioned Murders), it’s difficult to remember a president with such a tailwind of controversy. (Obamas CIA past still hasn’t entered the public conversation, but that’s a post for another time..)

Trump might be the best thing to ever happen to the world. Remember the story of the emperors new clothes?


&gt;&gt;A vain emperor hires weavers who promise him they will make him the best suit of clothes. The weavers are con-men who convince the emperor they are using a fine fabric invisible to anyone who is either unfit for his position or ""hopelessly stupid"". The con lies in that the weavers are actually only pretending to manufacture the clothes; they are making make-believe clothes which they mime. Thus, no one, not even the emperor nor his ministers can see the alleged ""clothes"", but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions, and the emperor does the same. &gt;&gt;Finally, the weavers report that the suit is finished, they mime dressing him, and the emperor marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear unfit for their positions or stupid. Then, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all, and the cry is taken up by others. 


Along with shaping opinion through the dispersion of accepted narratives, the media plays an important role in maintaining the status quo through its control of “common knowledge” - knowing what everyone else knows.
If you think others will fear or ridicule your beliefs, you’re far likely to not say anything. People generally want to be accepted and not viewed as radically different to their peers. But if you know other people likely share the same views as you, the mental block is gone and open discussion can take place. The internet has made it difficult for the media to continue providing this function to those who rule over us. Cue net neutrality. Voting bots... Cambridge Analytica..

It won’t work though. [The tipping point has already been reached.](http://www.wowzone.com/monkey.htm)
The crowd is pointing. Sniggers can be heard.

Soon we’ll all be laughing at just how stupid we were to have ever bought their bullshit.

361,The assault on Facebook is the scariest conspiracy around right now.,"For all of the fake news shared and data harvested, getting people to give up Facebook only serves the established institutions and their grip on power. There are so many examples, but here are a few: 


The West Virginia teacher's strike was accomplished without official union representation, but just coordinated through a Facebook group. 


More importantly, Facebook means control of the political news we get. I was just listening to Bernie Sanders in an interview talking about how he got 20 seconds of coverage from TV news in the last election, but he's been throwing Facebook town halls with millions of viewers recently. There are a lot of organizations looking to upset the Democratic primaries, and vote in candidates who care about voters, not corporate campaign donations. They're also organizing and spreading information on Facebook and social media. Without Facebook you're back to either letting the media decide who they cover, and what they cover. It seems like no surprise that this is hitting a fever pitch as we're running into the primaries for 2018. 


Social media has its problems and drawbacks, but it also allows people to share and amplify information without official editors deciding what can and can't be shared. This attack on Facebook is an attack on your right to receive and spread the information you choose. Reddit's nice, but your grandparents aren't on here, and they vote.

370,"Where do Asians fit into the whole ""illuminati, grand chess board, lucifer, albert pike letter predicting three world wars"" conspiracy timeline? They are half the Earth but never mentioned in the Bible, satanic prophecy, etc","Hi, I'm currently enrolled in an asian studies class at college, and it's been very interesting because I literally knew nothing about Asian history.

China has a crazy history, it invented government and taxation, amongst many other things almost 6000 years ago. It remained unchallenged as arguably the most advanced civilization on Earth with no competitors for a very long time, and they only fell behind due to an isolationist perspective while Europe began to accumulate technology and imperialize over the past 500 years.

East Asians also apparently have the highest IQ, except for Ashkenazi jews who have an average IQ 5 points higher.

What I'm getting at is, these east asain races are almost half the Earth's population, extremely high IQ and culturally very accomplished. We tend to look at asia as sort of a shithole, but that's only due to very recent global events.

Why is it that all these grandiose conspiracy theories never involve asian people? It's almost as if white people have delusions of grandeur and make these insanely bizarre and creative stories that have snowballed out of control. I mean what are Asians and what do they represent in the traditionally well known conspiracy theories?

**EDIT: Sorry, let me try to re-articulate. It just seems to me that virtually all paranormal/alien/demonic/religious conspiracy theories attribute white european accomplishments to some divine or demonic force, but they never acknowledge the (arguably) equal accomplishments of east asians. It's like they don't exist within the context of the ""illuminati"", 33rd degree, etc etc. It just sort of seems like white people are coming up with these grandiose theories about ourselves with zero acknowledgment towards asians.",conspiracy,1522097925,giantfegget,77,83,True,2018-03-26

This was a fantastic series that I can't recommend highly enough. There are many aspects of the story that I think are relevant for discussion here, including (possible spoilers):
  
* The coordinated effort across multiple branches and levels of U.S. government to shut down this group
* The way in which power and money corrupted the leaders of the group itself, despite its utopian visions
* The response from the architects and adherents of establishment spiritual/cultural/economic narratives and norms being challenged by the group

I’d figure with all the brainiacs out there with mad coding skills, there’d be a startup working on delivering the antithesis of Facebook. Maybe there are.

382,Facebook Takedown a False Flag?,"Does it seem strange to anyone else that pretty much the entire establishment is on board with this FB takedown?  Even Zuck the Cuck doesn't seem to mind too much.  If this wasn't a planned event it wouldn't be happening like this.  I find it hard to believe that this is an organic occurrence.


So far, the theory jumping out at me most is that this is the first major domino to fall in what will be a well-orchestrated clampdown on the mass dissemination of alternative news and memes.  This a return of the absolute rule of the mainstream media and a war on independent political discussion.


Think about it: while us web savvy individuals have always and will always populate boards that discuss the things covered up and blacked out by the MSM, right now the average normie, your aunt Sarah and your grandpa Dave, are only able to break out of the mass conditioning cycle due to the open, unfiltered discussion and sharing of news and current events that FB facilitates.


And when it's gone the normies aren't flocking to the next platform.  Sure, the kids will, the web-savvy will, but the real normies, the busy parents, the middle-aged and elderly; your parents and grandparents (you know, the average voter), are just going to go back to how life was before FB: getting all of their news and information from the mainstream media.


I'm not buying this one, folks.  This is, as usual, not what it seems.  Trump fucked the deep state hard in 2016 and they've got to ensure this shit doesn't continue.  Think about it.   


Edit:  Just want to say I actually hate Facebook and deleted my account in 2013.  I just realize I may have underestimated its importance in the information war.",conspiracy,1522101011,mucho_guayabo,8,11,True,2018-03-26
383,"Is the alleged poisoning of ex-russian spy Sergei Skripal, the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of our time?","It's an underbuild theory thus far but; Diplomats are being kicked out of at least 21 countries, of which are 16 European Union states, the UK, which blames Russia for poisoning. This will probably heat up and Russia will respond in a strong manner, and if not an Allie of Russia might. 

Just because it wasn't a successful murder, it was followed by a direct clams by the UK, that claims that the Russian state (the Kremlin), that ordered and provided the poison.

Theresa May has given The Kremlin and ultimatum; to explain how a former spy was poisoned in Salisbury, otherwise she will conclude it was an “unlawful use of force” by the Russian state against the UK.

This is similar to when  Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.

The Post-FBook internet, (And It Is approaching rapidly) will be a paid-to -subscribe for service under the guise of 'an assurance of data privacy'.

the result will be an Updated surveillance DB funded directly by the subscribers with ID verifiable information. 

This will be a stepping stone to issuing a digital internet ID card/ License for access to anything online that will become essential to the control of the internet.  eventually, anyone operating online outside ID verification and recorded action history will be akin to modern day web-piracy or driving without a license.

416,Observations on /r/Conspiracy,"This is just a few loose thoughts that I've gathered in my time on this sub, that I would like to start a sort of meta-conversation about.

1. **""The Left-Right divide is meaningless.""**

     This is true in general in areas of maybe foreign policy (Trump compared to Obama compared to Bush compared to Clinton and so on differ around the edges but have all continued / sustained / started wars in their own ways) and a couple others, but the two parties are not the same. Democrats want gun control, right? Does that mean they're the same as Republicans, or different? Republicans want transgender bathroom laws. Just like Democrats, right? Those are *real* issues. You can't act like voting for one party over the other doesn't matter when they differ on significant issues. They don't differ enough on every single important issue, but they do on enough of them that it still matters who you vote for.

2. **""This sub is being brigaded by /r/Politics / /r/The_Donald.""**

     Sometimes people disagree with you. Conspiracies aren't committed solely by Democrats or Republicans, and conspiracy theories aren't imagined solely by Democrats or Republicans. ""George Bush did 9/11"" and ""Obama is the antichrist"" aren't usually two thoughts held by the exact same group of people. 

     When you see something you disagree upvoted to the top of a thread in /r/Conspiracy, it is *not* proof that the subreddit is being brigaded. I mean, it's proof of ""something"", but not necessarily ""brigade"". Sometimes people disagree with you. Sometimes it just happens that there are more Trump supporters here than usual. Sometimes there's fewer. It's not just because it's a coordinated attack. Sometimes Trump does something embarassing and his supporters get off reddit and the majority of people left are left wingers who upvote left wing stuff.

3. **""You're clearly a [ correct the record, internet research agency, share blue, russian, koch brothers, soros-funded ] shill.""**

     There are shills on reddit. But, there are also people that disagree with you. Maybe the person you're arguing with really is a shill, but nothing productive comes from just tossing that accusation around. 

     Also, calling somebody who has been arguing with you for several comments in a row a ""bot"" is borderline stupid. Nobody is writing bots smart enough to have actual conversations. The ""bots"" are more likely to be the comments that throw out one highly controversial statement and then don't respond to anybody that challenges them (because they're bots, they wouldn't know how). 

4. **""If you don't believe my conspiracy theory / if you poke holes in my theory, you're not truly part of this community.""**

     I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like watching documentaries where people talk about stuff like the real meaning behind the pyramids, where Hitler disappeared to after they faked his death, who really shot JFK, etc. I don't believe 99% of the theories I read about those things. In fact, since most of the conspiracy theories about those events contradict each other, you'd have to be literally insane to believe probably any two of them. However, of course I still enjoy reading them. It's like a fun ""what if"" type thing.

     I also believe in certain, um, ""more serious"", conspiracy theories. Like ones involving corporations dividing the world up into fiefdoms they can control and extract money from.

     I think the earth is round. I'd still like to read your theory on why it's not. But the second you call me a ""shill for round earth"" of course I'm going to downvote your comment.

5. **""The downvotes prove how right I am.""**

     I mean, this is just stupid on its face. It's the rallying cry of idiots who've already lost the argument. Now, of course, there *are* times where the person who is correct is being downvoted. But there's also times where the person who's *incorrect* is being downvoted. So no, downvotes aren't proof of anything.

6. **""If the mainstream media is saying it, obviously the opposite is true.""**

     Even if you believe the media coordinates its messaging in order to mislead the public, it'd be silly to think literally everything they said is exactly 100% wrong. They would lie by outright lying sometimes, omission of truth other times, selective truth sometimes, and sometimes they'd just tell you the actual truth because the truth fits with what they want you to think anyway. If the mainstream media comes out and says something negative about the politician you like, you can't assume that just because they said it it's automatically not true. 

     By the way, you interested in a *real* conspiracy? The term ""mainstream media"" is a marketing ploy developed by the conservative media to paint themselves as the ""truth telling underdogs"" in a world dominated by the ""liberal media"", while those same conservative media figures constantly talk about how *they are the most watched and listened to*. Ben Shapiro claims to have the most listened podcast behind Oprah. Fox News claims to be the most watched cable news network. Rush Limbaugh claims to be the most listened to radio talk show host. But at the same time, they all claim to be the underdogs compared to the ""liberal media"". It's a marketing ploy. It's one media company, telling you not to patronize the other media company. Mar-ket-ing. Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, whoever, these people exist to get you to listen to their shows more, so that you'll listen to the commercials that air during their show, so you'll buy more bullshit, so those companies will pay them more money. That's it. They don't like you. They don't give a shit about your life. 

     Dude if Pepsi walked up to you and said, ""don't believe the lives of the mainstream soda company (((coke))), we're clearly the superior brand"" you'd laugh in their faces. But when your media company you prefer says it, you adopt their corporate advertising logo into your own vocabulary. Gross.",conspiracy,1522106919,denreyc,14,28,True,2018-03-26

The app is designed differently than FB, but their opportunity for gathering data on users is just as critical. in order to use Snapchat, users basically always stare directly into their well-lit screens or directly into the forward-facing camera, presenting a well-lit face ready for machine-learning. It is very conceivable, in my opinion, to think that they are tracking our eye movements (and possibly dilation) while looking at different images. Users must allow the Snapchat app access to their cameras in order to send a snap, so it is possible that the camera is watching you, even when you are just looking at content. 

With these in place, Snapchat could very easily track your eye movements and determine what exactly you are looking at, for how long, and in what order for every picture, video, and piece of content you see. If they are able to track eye dilation, then they can also determine what excites you, scares you, etc. The value this holds for commercial and political applications terrifies me.

462,Comprehensive list of agent provocateur tactics.,"Hey folks how ya doing.

Okay, so today we're going to go over tips and tricks to spot agent provocateur tactics, the importance of reviewing post history, and some key rules to remember when engaging with opposing viewpoints of questionable integrity.

First of all, let's differentiate between Trolling and Shilling. A lot of people will say they are the same thing out of ignorance. That's not to say that someone who equates the two is stupid, just uninformed as to the real relation between the terms.

So let's get started.

PART ONE: TROLLS

We'll kick this off with a definition:

Troll (informal): make a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them.

Trolling is, at its core, a morally bankrupt activity. Regardless of belief in the content of the message, trying to Troll someone is primarily an attempt to elicit a negative response out of someone else. As such, Trolling comes in many forms, and usually commit a fallacy of some kind.

Some Trolls are more subtle than others. On one end of the spectrum is the Low-Effort Troll, trying to get a rise out of someone purely through Personal Attacks, Imitation-Baiting, Excessive use of Sarcasm/Questioning/Italics, etc. These Trolls are easy to spot.

On the other hand, the High-Effort Troll will incorporate sneakiness: Feigned Agreement, Appeal to Authority and Undermining Tactics. A Troll that starts out agreeing with you will be harder to spot, and often will hook their target deeply into discussion before they realize they are being trolled. A lot of High-Effort Trolling tactics involve the ambiguity of emotional load that comes with conversing entirely through the written word: Always remember that words and sentences can have multiple meanings depending on inflection, and if you are in doubt about the sincerity of a comment, always try speaking it out loud a few times with different levels of implied sarcasm in your voice. If it seems like the argument could turn against you easily, be cautious.

So how do you fight a Troll? It's simple: you don't. The Troll is there specifically to fight. By engaging him, you ensure his victory. Your argument may be airtight, you might bring all the evidence you need to convince any rational person. The Troll doesn't care, he's already made you waste your time and gotten a rise out of you. So remember the cardinal rule of internet discourse: DON'T FEED THE TROLLS.

PART TWO: SHILLS

Time for another definition. This one is a little older, and not directly relevant to Shilling on the Internet, but I picked it because it exposes the core deceit at play:

Shill (slang): a confidence trickster's assistant, esp a person who poses as an ordinary customer, gambler, etc, in order to entice others to participate.

The Shill is the guy on the street, beating the Huckster at Three-Card Monty, waving around a stack of twenties that he just won for everybody to see. If Trolling is a morally bankrupt activity, Shilling is moral corruption. The Shill may know they are in the wrong (and likely do), but does not care as long as they make money. As a result, Shilling is a higher art-form than Trolling. While the Troll can skate by on base insults or sarcasm, the Shill must be a seasoned debater, be able to argue a position well, and must have the resources to debunk or otherwise undermine the position of their opponent. If they are a true Shill, they will be all of these things. After all, they are by definition paid for their services.

The most important distinction between a Shill and a Troll is a matter of targeting. Where you, the debater, is the target for a Troll, the Shill is targeting the audience, i.e. the random person who curiously stumbles into the thread and doesn't know what to think about the subject at hand. The Shill isn't paid to enrage the skeptic, he is paid to influence the debate.

The effective Shill will have their own method of undermining an argument, but will generally use one of three methods. They are all effective if executed well, and are all psychological in nature.

 1. The Professor: This tactic attempts to present the Shill as the rational, intelligent side of the argument. He will seem to take the moral and logical high ground. His verbosity will only be matched by the scalpel-like precision with which he wields it. He will refer you to mainstream news articles proving his point. This is a very effective method, because to the average curious person he will seem legitimately intelligent. Luckily, it's implementation requires a dedicated and well-read individual to pull off, and is not seen as often as others. Unfortunately, when it does turn up, it is often nearly indistinguishable from a genuine engaged commenter presenting his viewpoint. Because of this, accusing The Professor of Shilling should be a last resort: If you can secure a genuine victory through continued debate, it is much preferred to calling him out.

 2. The Saboteur: Similar in rhetoric to High-Effort Trolling, but decidedly more sophisticated. The Saboteur will take your side of the argument and blow it so far out of proportion it loses credibility with anybody who isn't already a part of the debate. A classic example is the ""missile plane"" theory found fairly frequently in 9/11 skeptic circles, i.e. ""the planes were cruise missiles mocked up to look like planes."" This is of course absurd, as the impacts in no way resemble cruise missile explosions. But it is close enough to the ""drone flights"" theory (in contrast, a much sounder argument) to be linked in the minds of an uninformed reader, and therefore the former theory reduces the credibility of the latter. This is an easier tactic to combat, but requires long-winded responses that thoroughly deconstruct the issue at hand.

 3. The Incredulous Bystander: This method of Shilling is the most common of the three. The Shill comes into a debate in progress, and commits the Fallacy of Personal Incredulity ad nauseum. ""I'm sorry, I just can't accept that [abc] is [xyz]. It's just impossible, there's no way."" This will go on and on. No matter what you throw at him, he will come back with the same incredulity. The purpose is simple: make the poster look like their argument is too fantastical for the average person to agree with. Although it's very easy to defeat The Incredulous Bystander by simple logical arguments, be careful. You have to know when to disengage, or the sheer repetition will make your argument seem desperate. Make a final argument against their disingenuous bafflement early, within three replies if possible. Then disengage completely, even if they come back to try and lead you on some more.

Like I said, there are variations on each of these paradigms, and each Shill's methods will be different. More intelligent or better-equipped Shills will use dirty tactics (Vote Manipulation, Multiple Account Shilling, etc.). Sometimes the combined effort of a group of Shills or Shill Accounts can simply be too much to combat alone. In these cases, it's simply best to downvote and disengage. Not every battle can be won.

PART THREE: HOW TO I.D. A TROLL/SHILL ACCOUNT

Thanks to the (fairly) open nature of account creation and tracking on reddit, certain things can be learned about an account from the Account Overview Page. Patterns emerge in every account, regardless of if the account is an active Troll/Shill, or not. It is through the account's activity and past comments that one can glean insight into the intentions of an individual.

A Regular Poster will look something like the account I linked above, which is mine. Post history and comment content may be concentrated to certain subreddits and ideas at times, but will more likely be varied with little recognizable pattern. This is because the individual behind the account doesn't have an agenda beyond personal entertainment (or knowledge acquisition) on the site.

Since Trolling is an activity anybody with a chip on their shoulder can do, not every Troll will be a dedicated Troll Account. Sometimes, people Troll without realizing they're doing it. But there are some hallmarks to look out for: conspicuously high numbers of short, one- or two-sentence responses, a tendency to make every statement a question, abnormal distribution of comments (i.e. the last 50 comments in one thread), and excessive use of casual ridicule when responding to serious comments (""lolwat/get your head checked/wow you're stupid"", etc). Additionally, another way to identify part-time Trolls and Flamers is to check their comment history for key subreddits. If somebody shows up and says something questionably racist, derogatory or inflammatory, look for subreddits that might be indicative of that account holder's moral leanings (for example, posts to /r/whiterights, /r/greatapes and /r/ZOG are all good indicators that the poster is racist. Call them out on it!).

A Shill Account will look decidedly different, and might at first glance seem like a normal poster. But there are a couple of key identifiers that can help you form your opinion on the intentions of the account holder:

Karma Authority and Perceived Age: Shills go through accounts like cigarettes. Once a Shill account is identified as such, it is nearly useless for anything except vote manipulation. And reddit's mods (at least, the good ones) have gotten pretty good at identifying accounts that break site rules. This is especially true for /r/conspiracy and a few related subs. So Shills are often stuck using extremely young accounts with very little commentary added to the site as a whole. These accounts have very little authority with the more skeptical member of the audience smart enough to look at the account history. Seeing zero karma, an age measured in days instead of months, and less than a page of posts doesn't invoke trust in that account's opinion. So Shill accounts will be ""aged"": The account will be created, one post (or a few) will be made, and that post's karma will be manipulated by the Shill's other accounts, just enough to get the karma up around 150~200. The account will then be left untouched for anywhere between 4 months and a year. Once this period of time is up, the account is brought back to life and the Shill starts posting. Now, the less-thorough reader will see an account that is 7 months old, has 80 link and 225 comment karma, and looks to be active. If they scroll to the bottom of the comment history, they would see that it's a fake set up to look that way, but most people won't. Always check for Perceived Age. If the history goes beyond 20 pages of comments, chances are good the account is legit.

Defense Of The Tyrant: Thanks to the paid nature of their job, the Shill will not advocate reasonable positions. They are specifically here to lessen the impact of questionable material, undermine the opposition to negative aspects of the Status Quo, and make skeptics and activists look bad. The most current example is the rampant Shilling for the Police found in nearly every thread that covers Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Ferguson, Police Brutality or related issues. It is not a popular opinion to defend tyranny, and yet for every post condemning police violence, there is another apologist (or downright authoritarian) comment accusing any protest of undermining the authority of the stewards of public safety. Some of these are regular (if horribly misguided) posters. But it is absolutely an indicator of Shilling, and if you see it combined with other indicators, there is a good chance they were paid to skew the conversation further towards confusion, vitriol, animosity and gridlock. 

""Deadly Serious"": As has been previously stated, the Shill has a specific goal of making their argument look better than another. In this regard, they will use every tool they have to undermine their opponent. One logical fallacy is commonly used: Appeal to Emotion, AKA The ""Deadly Serious"" argument. When you appeal to emotion, you are attempting to scare the audience into reactive thinking. ""Harassing Police is Deadly Serious"" is a good example. You inject the fear of personal safety into the conversation: ""What if the cops just quit? Rampant crime! I don't want to have to fear for myself and my children! I don't like it, but this guy has a point."" It's a fallacy because emotion is irrational. The reality is there is a problem in this country, and whether or not police will ""put up with"" protesting is completely unrelated to the actual issue of the creeping authoritarianism plaguing law enforcement throughout America. Again, anybody can Appeal to Emotion accidentally, but if you see it over and over again in the account history, it's most likely deliberate abuse of the fallacy.

PART FOUR: BEST PRACTICES FOR FIGHTING SHILLS

So, you've identified a Shill. You've decided not to put up with it. What do you do?

First of all, keep calm. Engaging in heated debate makes both sides of the argument seem irrational, to your detriment. The Shill doesn't have to look good, he just has to make you look bad, or without that, make the debate so incomprehensibly vitriolic that the audience decides to leave and do something else. By making your case logically, rationally, and without emotional attachment or useless insults, you will come off as logical, rational, informed, and respectable.

Second: Debate the Topic primarily, not the Opposition. Attacks on Authority and Integrity are useful only once Authority and Integrity are in doubt. Until then (or if you are up against The Professor), you are just giving the Shill more ammo to use against you. Stay on topic, don't get lost in semantics and nitpicking, state your case simply. If you do things right, most Shills will give up before you.

Third: Karma is Useless. Ever since reddit changed the voting scheme there has been absolutely no point to tracking Karma as an indicator of winning a conversation or not. Brigading is absolutely a problem whether or not the mods acknowledge it, and chances are good your posts will be net negative, even if you are clearly winning your argument. Don't let it get to you! It's an imaginary number that is easily skewed.

I'm pretty close to character limit at this point, so I figure it's about time to stop this train. Comments, Questions, anything is welcome. This is a rough outline of my own experiences with logic and debate in the treacherous semantic waters we swim in, and is by no means complete. Take these ideas and interpret them, expand on them, make them your own. Then spread it where you can. Any commenter can be a strong debater, if they know the pitfalls and traps that are set for them.

Oh, almost forgot. This post is also an open invitation to any Ex-Shills that want to share their knowledge.

Remember folks, Stay Skeptical.

If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."" **—David Rockefeller's Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)**


""The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. **—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets**

""The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future."" **—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies**

For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared ""ammunition"" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... ""The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. ""The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. **—Curtis Dall, FDR's son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law**

466,The Broadway Play I saw was Jewish Propaganda,"I went to a play on Saturday night in downtown Orlando. It was called “The Waitress”. It seemed like everyone in the crowd was enjoying it greatly. After all the masses are stupid cowards that do what they’re told and they laugh at things in the play that were supposed to be jokes but weren’t funny at all. The main demographic of this play was old white Liberals, so obviously not the most redpilled of people.

What ticked me off about the play was the blatant Jewish propaganda that nobody seemed to notice but me. 

The star of the play was a beautiful Aryan woman. Nordic woman. She was a southern waitress at a pie shop. She is conflicted because she lives at home with an abusive husband. The way they portray this guy is absolutely laughable and is a complete caricature. The guy is a physical laborer, has a country accent, is extremely stupid and is an abusive husband. This is definitely the way the Jew feels about the white working man in Rural America. When the girl finds out she is pregnant with him, she wants to leave him because she doesn’t feel he would be a good father. When she finally tells him that she is going to be a mom, he hugs her real close and says something just really stupid. He says “just promise me you’ll never love that baby more than you love me, ok.” 

Then the girl starts to fall in love with her new doctor. The doctor that will deliver her baby. This doctor is like a 5 foot 10 skinny guy with a high pitched nasally voice. I don’t know if the character was supposed to be a Jew or not but the actor definitely was. The character was like a Liberal doctor from Connecticut, he was the complete antithesis of her husband. Of course this shy well meaning Jew is portrayed as a good guy. Anyways they end up falling in love and the girl tells her former husband to scram and tells him that he will never see her and his kid again and of course the crowd roars in applause as the woman tells the man to screw off even though it is his kid too. 

I also heard them use references that only a true conspiracy theorist could catch. They shouted out the number 33. We all know the significance of that number and the Free Masonic connections. Also she was getting advice from an old man and this old man talked about the time he had sex and made his wife scream. All the way back in 1948. Well what do we know that happened in 1948? The State Of Israel was founded. 

So I have to say this play was totally produced by Jews. From the caricature of the white working man, the goy, who was portrayed as an idiot, someone with no control over his temper as he had fits of rage, an egotistical megalomaniac, and kind of rapey. To the Jewish doctor that was portrayed as some type of innocent saint like man and he ends up getting the beautiful Aryan girl away from the bosom of her own people. To the amount of affairs and gay propaganda and feminist propaganda and race mixing propaganda going on in the side stories of the play. I have to say I hated this play, it was Jewish Propaganda, and it was not funny even though pretty much everyone in the crowd was laughing. Also I looked at the names of the people who donated money to this performing arts center. Probably 50% of the names on the list were Jewish looking names despite the fact that they make up just 2% of the General population. It’s just a disgrace. 

Here’s a video of an Indian Bollywood producer exposing the sheer amount of Jewish influence in Bollywood too

474,Russian Government is trying to cover up more than 300 deaths at the Kemerovo mall fire and how the Fire Escapes were locked.,"Credit to /u/Max_Stern, copied at timestamp of this comment. To add I did not come up with this theory /u/Max_Stern did. I figured this would be a good place for it to be seen and I self posted so if the old comment was deleted it could still be found. 

This shopping mall had cinema inside on the 4th floor with 3 halls. March 25 is the premiere day for some cartoons in Russia so some school (maybe schools, idk) organized a trip for their children, they took buses to drive them there. Children were accompanied by their teacher and one other man (maybe woman, no info) but they (teacher and other) didn't want to see these films so they told cinema stuff to block the doors of two halls so children can't run from halls to somewhere unattended. Then they went shopping while children were watching the films.

Ministry of Emergency Situations tells that fire probably occurred because of gas tank that was used to cook popcorn or something, that's what you see on the gif.

Fire spread rapidly and the most important part that fire alarm didn't work. Today government told like some stuff member disabled the signal when alarm activated or smth like that but other people say that there was no fire alarm signal at all. There is also an information that shopping mall owners paid to someone in city government to avoid installing the fire alarm, fire detectors were just fake piece of plastic.
Actually people tell that they didn't know about the fire until they heard that someone is shouting.

Remember these two blocked halls in the cinema? Nobody opened them, children and their parents (mostly women) were just blocked inside the cinema. They were burnt alive, that's not what you see in this post but that's how they met the death. Wives were calling their husbands and telling that they are blocked and that they will die because they can't escape, emergency exits were somehow blocked as well (idk about it).

When rescuers arrived they were acting slowly, telling to people outside that there are no people in the cinema (idk maybe they assumed that everybody left the shopping mall already because it's not like we don't have evacuation plans) but that's it.

Example of cinema hall before and after: https://i.imgur.com/KFt6SRb.jpg
Amount of tickets when the fire occured: https://i.imgur.com/WqZnJtc.jpg

People don't believe the government now, officials say that 64 died but actually there were way more people inside the cinema and parents sign an NDA when they go to identify the corpses so I assume that this is true. Some sources say that more than 350 people died, mostly children.
I just saw an interview with man who lost his wife, 3 children and his sister, he was saying the same, rescuers were acting fucking slowly at first, they ignored people who was saying about blocked children in the cinema; Later, when the fire was extinguished and they began a search operation, they were taking out bodies non-stop, police wasn't allowing people to see this, office workers in building on the opposite of the street were forbidden to take pictures or videos; it's 300-350 dead people, city morgues are full, parents sign NDAs, etc.

And yes, on the national television they don't even say that doors were blocked, they just omit this part, only one channel said that «the doors were tightly closed» (wtf??).

It's really, really bad, sadly I can't translate everything I read and see, amount of information is huge and all this information and videos are in Russian obviously but the situation is way worse.
There are screenshots of chat groups in VK social network where some young girl (like 14 yo) says «we are on fire ... probably goodbye».

I mean, I just wanted to share some info because even Russian citizens don't get the truth from official sources, I just visit all these Telegram channels, WhatsApp groups, etc, where people from Kemerovo tell about this situation.

I apologize for text mistakes, hard to quickly put all of this together -- english isn't my native obviously.

Edit 1: the teacher who accompanied the children probably evacuated, some people say that they saw her on the street, current location is unknown.

494,Throwback to 2009 - IS THE UNITED STATES BEING BLACKMAILED INTO WAR ON IRAN?,"There has been talk of war with Iran going back several years now, mostly with Israel initiating and various AIPAC-supported US politicians nodding sagely in agreement. But the fly in the ointment has always been Russia, which is not only actually building Iran's power station but has a mutual defense contract with its 7th largest trading partner. Putin has made it very clear that in the event of war, Russia will support Iran at least logistically.

In November of 2007, both American and Israeli support and training to Georgia increased significantly, along with pressuer for Georgia to clamp down on the breakaway regions. This led to the thankfully brief war between Russia and Georgia in August of 2008.

In hindsight, it appears the strategic thinking had been to create a prolonged border conflict along the Caucasus Mountains, in order to limit Russia's ability to supply Iran by convoy thruogh the tunnels under the mountains. If that was the plan, it failed miserably as Russia blew through the Goergian forces as if they were wet kleenex. More than likely Putin realized the real issuer and decided to send a message.

In any event, no sooner had it bome obvious that the passes throough Georgia would remain open then talk of an attack on Iran began to fade from the media, and talk of going into Pakistan began to appear, even ahead of November's convenient ""terrorist"" attack in Mumbai.

As we approached the anniversary of September 11th, there was concern that there might be another attack of some kimd possibly false-flag to spur the nation onto yet another war. And it now appears that there may have indeed been one after all!

On January 27th, 2009, Representive Paul Kanjorski (D-PA), Chairman of the Capitol Markets Subcommitee, was answering questions on C-SPAN. At 2:20 the big ugly secret came out. There had been an electronic run on the banks in Mid-September. Within an hour, some $550 billion was electronically withdrawn from the money market accounts. The claim is that had the government not blocked further withdrawals and stared offering guarantees, the US and World economies would have been collapsed. Kanjorski gives the date as ""Around"" September 15th, then mentions that the activity took place on Thursday.

The Thursday before the 15th was September 11th.

Now, had our enemies in wealthy Arab nations brought our banking system to the edge of collapse, we would have heard about it the day that it happened. But prior to Kanjorski's admission on C-Span, from September 11th 2008 to Januray 27th, 2009, not a word of the intentional attack on the US economy appeared in the corporate media. Even after Kanjorski's admission, ABCNNBBCBS remains ominously silent. Just two weeks after this financial attack, any reporters that might have been looking into it were distracted as Israel attacked Gaza and kicked off a very news-worthy invasion.

Meanwhile, rather than aknowledge the attack, the US Government threatened Congress into looting the taxpayers to make up the lost funds.

And now we are seeing a ramping up of the pressure to invade Iran again.

So, from here it looks like we may have dodged another false-flag attack on September 11th. But with that attack came a warning that whoever was behind it would try it again if certain foreign policy demands were not met.

Which would explain why the Obama administration is promoting the already-discredited claims of an Iranian threat put forward by his predecessor, and why his staff is dominated by strong supporters of Israel.

10,Why do the same people that see 'anonymous sources' in the media as proof of fake news but put so much trust in Q?,"The title says it all, really. 

Many 'anonymous sources' proved to have truth, hence all the scandals that have hit the white house. One example, the top post on /r/politics is ""Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador"" and that was according to ""according to current and former U.S. officials"". And of course, this was soon confirmed. 

This is just one example, but there's many. A lot of people, from individuals here to t_d to regular folks on the right who back Trump, just dismiss anonymous sources as fake news, ignoring that journalists in big news organizations have to do many things to prove the validity of the claims before they are published, which is ironic since many of the MAGA sites such as truepundit or conservative tree house function more as blogs without all of those traditional checks that journalists at the NYTimes have to do.

If you look at the number of times that the anti-Trump media has actually retracted a story, it's far and few in between. That isn't to say that it's coverage of Trump is perfect, but that it tries to actually report on facts. However, this isn't what I want to ask.

What I do want to ask is why do the same people that see 'anonymous sources' in the media as proof of fake news but put so much trust in Q?

I've seen things that prove him/them to be in a high up position, but that's about it. Just because he was on AF1 doesn't mean he's a top military brass that knows about any top secret government plans. Seems more to me that he's posting cryptic stuff that occasionally hits when hindsight is apparent. For example, the latest ""5) I hear you"" with 5 fingers looks completely coincidental. Maybe if it were from an official photo instead of a talk with students where somebody took the picture at the right time I would believe it, but in the end I'm just not buying it.

34,What should we really be be afraid of?,"Longtime r/conspiracy lurker.

I'm starting to think we should be less concerned about these small events, and more concerned about the overall lasting effects. The long play.

For instance, I think 20 years ago if this sub existed and there was enough proof (and this sub posts a lot of proof of cover-ups, conspiracies, etc), there would be an uprising. Tons of coverage, and maybe a lot of things coming to light in the media. People might stop believing everything they are told and start listening to the truth.

Today, it's about control of the children and teens and what they believe as they begin to procreate and create families of mindless sheep believing everything that comes through the tube. It's a long play, perhaps similar to how China is playing the US to become the next superpower. Every shooting, every event, is a small step to erode confidence in ""the old way to do things"" and usher in an era of government control, slowly but surely. I'm listening to this CNN town hall of the shooting and can't believe people are buying into what is clearly an act, a show. Or perhaps it's not and people are THAT desensitized to violence that they act like it's no big deal and can have full composure after losing friends/family on live TV just days prior.

I think FOX is trying to steer the attention away from the students protesting in Florida and have tried to create their own story with CNN, claiming that CNN is force feeding students with pre-made questions and answers. 

FOX says that CNN is providing these kids with fake questions and answers, but this kid is the only one to say anything.  After this kid came out and said something, Tucker Carlson interviews him and he can't stop looking to his right...it looks exactly like he is looking into a teleprompter and getting fed the answers that FOX wants to hear.

This is extremely hypocritical and something that should be looked into.  This wouldn't be the first time FOX was doing something hypocritical, so I don't find this idea to be too far-fetched.  CNN also denies feeding this student questions or answers, which may not mean much to some, but with this student answering questions directly from a teleprompter, I don't find it too hard to believe.

How powerful are they?

&gt;**By Prof. Dr. Mujahid Kamran** -  http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/who-really-controls-the-world

&gt;*Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organised, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.*
– Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States (1856-1924)

&gt;*So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.*
– Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister
(1804-1881)

&gt;The advent of the industrial revolution, the invention of a banking system based on usury, and scientific and technological advancements during the past three centuries have had three major consequences. These have made the incredible concentration of wealth in a few hands possible, have led to the construction of increasingly deadly weapons culminating in weapons of mass destruction, and have made it possible to mould the minds of vast populations by application of scientific techniques through the media and control of the educational system.

&gt;The wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and even beyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and for them, most of mankind is garbage – “human garbage.” It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.

&gt;It was Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild (1840-1915) who once said: “I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the British Empire on which the sun never sets. The man that controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.” What was true of the British Empire is equally true of the US Empire, controlled remotely by the London based Elite through the Federal Reserve System. Judged by its consequences, the Federal Reserve System is the greatest con job in human history.

&gt;It is sad and painful that man’s most beautiful construction, and the source of most power and wealth on earth, viz. scientific knowledge – the most sublime, most powerful and most organised expression of man’s inherent gift of thought, wonder and awe – became a tool for subjugation of humanity, a very dangerous tool in the hands of a tiny group of men. These men “hire” the scientist and take away, as a matter of right, the power the scientist creates through his inventions. This power is then used for their own purposes, at immense human and material cost to mankind. The goal of this handful of men, the members of the wealthiest families on the planet, the Elite, is a New World Order, a One World Government, under their control.

&gt;Secrecy and anonymity is integral to the operations of the Elite as is absolute ruthlessness, deep deception and the most sordid spying and blackmail. The Elite pitches nations against each other, and aims at the destruction of religion and other traditional values, creates chaos, deliberately spreads poverty and misery, and then usurps power placing its stooges in place. These families “buy while the blood is still flowing in the streets” (Rothschild dictum). Wars, “revolutions” and assassinations are part of their tactics to destroy traditional civilisation and traditional religions (as in Soviet Russia), amass wealth and power, eliminate opponents, and proceed relentlessly towards their avowed goal, generation after generation. They operate through covert and overt societies and organisations.

&gt;Professor Carroll Quigley wrote:

&gt;*The powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands to be able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in private meetings and conferences.… The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralisation of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury to all other economic groups.*

&gt;Winston Churchill, who was eventually “bored by it all,” wrote around 1920:

&gt;*From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, Bela Kun, Rosa Luxembourg, and Emma Goldman, this world wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played a definitely recognisable role in the tragedy of French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the nineteenth century, and now at last, this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads, and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.*

&gt;**The High Cabal Exposed by JFK**

&gt;It was in the dark days of World War II that Churchill referred to the existence of a “High Cabal” that had brought about unprecedented bloodshed in human history. Churchill is also said to have remarked about the Elite: “They have transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia…” (quoted by John Coleman in The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, Global Publications 2006). Who are ‘they’?

&gt;Consider the 1961 statement of US President John F. Kennedy (JFK) before media personnel:

&gt;*The word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people, inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, secret oaths and secret proceedings. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy, that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. It depends on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published, its mistakes are buried, not headlined, and its dissenters are silenced, not praised, no expenditure is questioned, no secret revealed… I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.”*

&gt;Secret societies, secret oaths, secret proceedings, infiltration, subversion, intimidation – these are the words used by JFK!

&gt;On June 4, 1963, JFK ordered the printing of Treasury dollar bills instead of Federal Reserve notes (Executive Order 11110). He also ordered that once these had been printed, the Federal Reserve notes would be withdrawn, and the Treasury bills put into circulation. A few months later (November 22, 1963) he was killed in broad daylight in front of the whole world – his brains blown out. Upon assumption of power, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, immediately reversed the order to switch to Treasury bills showing very clearly why JFK was murdered. Another order of JFK, to militarily disengage from the Far East by withdrawing US “advisors” from Vietnam, was also immediately reversed after his death. After the Cuban crisis JFK wanted peaceful non-confrontational coexistence with the Soviet Union and that meant no wars in the world. He knew the next war would be nuclear and there would be no winners.

&gt;The defence industry and the banks that make money from war belong to the Elite. The Elite subscribes to a dialectical Hegelian philosophy, as pointed out by Antony Sutton, under which they bring about ‘controlled conflict’. The two world wars were ‘controlled conflicts’! Their arrogance, their ceaseless energy, their focus, their utter disregard for human life, their ability to plan decades in advance, to act on that planning, and their continual success are staggering and faith-shaking.

&gt;Statements by men like Disraeli, Wilson, Churchill, JFK and others should not leave any doubt in the mind of the reader about who controls the world. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wrote in November 1933 to Col. Edward House: “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centres has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” It may be recalled that Andrew Jackson, US President from 1829-1837, was so enraged by the tactics of bankers (Rothschilds) that he said: “You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.”

&gt;**Interlocking Structure of Elite Control**

&gt;In his book Big Oil and Their Bankers in the Persian Gulf: Four Horsemen, Eight Families and Their Global Intelligence, Narcotics and Terror Network, Dean Henderson states: “My queries to bank regulatory agencies regarding stock ownership in the top 25 US bank holding companies were given Freedom of Information Act status, before being denied on ‘national security’ grounds. This is ironic since many of the bank’s stockholders reside in Europe.” This is, on the face of it, quite astonishing but it goes to show the US government works not for the people but for the Elite. It also shows that secrecy is paramount in Elite affairs. No media outlet will raise this issue because the Elite owns the media. Secrecy is essential for Elite control – if the world finds out the truth about the wealth, thought, ideology and activities of the Elite there would be a worldwide revolt against it. Henderson further states:

&gt;*The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) own the Four Horsemen of Oil (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco); in tandem with other European and old money behemoths. But their monopoly over the global economy does not end at the edge of the oil patch. According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stockholders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation.*

&gt;It is well known that in 2009, of the top 100 largest economic entities of the world, 44 were corporations. The wealth of these families, which are among the top 10% shareholders in each of these, is far in excess of national economies. In fact, total global GDP is around 70 trillion dollars. The Rothschild family wealth alone is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. So is the case with the Rockefellers who were helped and provided money all along by the Rothschilds. The US has an annual GDP in the range of 14-15 trillion dollars. This pales into insignificance before the wealth of these trillionaires. With the US government and most European countries in debt to the Elite, there should be absolutely no doubt as to who owns the world and who controls it. To quote Eustace Mullins from his book The World Order:

&gt;*The Rothschilds rule the US through their Foundations, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Federal Reserve System with no serious challenges to their power. Expensive ‘political campaigns’ are routinely conducted, with carefully screened candidates who are pledged to the program of the World Order. Should they deviate from the program, they would have an ‘accident’, be framed on a sex charge, or indicted in some financial irregularity.*

&gt;The Elite members operate in absolute unison against public benefit, against a better life for mankind in which the individual is free to develop his or her innate creativity, a life free of war and bloodshed. James Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defence of the US, became aware of Elite intrigue and had, according to Jim Marrs, accumulated 3,000 pages of notes to be used for writing a book. He died in mysterious circumstances and was almost certainly murdered. His notes were taken away and a sanitised version made public after one year! Just before he died, almost fifteen months before the outbreak of the Korean War, he had revealed that American soldiers would die in Korea! Marrs quotes Forrestal: “These men are not incompetent or stupid. Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favour.” The Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the mother of all these, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, are bodies where decisions about the future of mankind are arrived at. Who set these up and control them? The “international bankers” of course.

&gt;In his book The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World, Col. Fletcher Prouty, who was the briefing officer to the President of the US from 1955-1963, writes about “an inner sanctum of a new religious order.” By the phrase Secret Team he means a group of “security-cleared individuals in and out of government who receive secret intelligence data gathered by the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) and who react to those data.” He states: “The power of the Team derives from its vast intra-governmental undercover infrastructure and its direct relationship with great private industries, mutual funds and investment houses, universities, and the news media, including foreign and domestic publishing houses.” He further adds: “All true members of the Team remain in the power centre whether in office with the incumbent administration or out of office with the hard-core set. They simply rotate to and from official jobs and the business world or the pleasant haven of academe.”

&gt;**Training the Young for Elite Membership**

&gt;It is very remarkable as to how ‘they’ are able to exercise control and how ‘they’ always find people to carry out the job, and how is it ‘they’ always make the ‘right’ decision at the right time? This can only be possible if there exists a hidden program of inducting and training cadres mentally, ideologically, philosophically, psychologically and ability-wise, over prolonged periods of time and planting them in the centres of power of countries like the US, UK, etc. This training would begin at a young age in general. There must also be a method of continual appraisal, by small groups of very highly skilled men, of developing situations with ‘their’ men who are planted throughout the major power centres of the world so that immediate ‘remedial’ action, action that always favours Elite interests, can be taken. How does that happen?

&gt;It is in finding answers to these questions that the role of secret societies and their control of universities, particularly in the US, assumes deeper importance. The work done by men like Antony Sutton, John Coleman, Eustace Mullins and others is ground breaking. Mankind owes a debt to such scholars who suffer for truth but do not give in. Whenever you trace the money source of important initiatives designed to bring about major wars, lay down policies for the future, enhance control of the Elite over mankind, etc., you will invariably find them linked to the so called banking families and their stooges operating out of Foundations.

&gt;In April 2008 I was among approximately 200 Vice Chancellors, Rectors and Presidents of universities from Asia, Africa, Europe and the US at a two day Higher Education Summit for Global Development, held at the US State Department in Washington DC. The Summit was addressed by five US Secretaries, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The real emphasis throughout the Summit was only on one thing – that universities in developing countries operate in partnership with foundations so that global problems could be solved! These are private foundations and the only way to understand this emphasis is to realise the US government is owned by those who own these foundations. As an aside the inaugural address was delivered by the war criminal responsible for millions of deaths in Rwanda, trained in US military institutions, and awarded a doctorate – Dr. Paul Kagame! The very first presentation was made by the CEO of the Agha Khan Foundation!

&gt;In a fascinating study of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, Antony Sutton uncovered numerous aspects of profound importance about this one society. In his book America’s Secret Establishment – An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones, Sutton points out there is a set of “Old Line American Families and New Wealth” that dominates The Order (of Skull &amp; Bones) – the Whitney family, the Stimson family, the Bundy family, the Rockefeller family, the Harriman family, the Taft family, the Bush family, and so on. He also points out that there is a British connection:

&gt;*The links between the Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. Notably the British establishment also founded a University – Oxford University, and especially All Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called ‘The Group’. The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes’ ‘inner circle’). The Order in the US links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families… There is an Illuminati connection.*

&gt;Every year 15 young men, and very recently women, have been inducted into The Order from Yale students since 1832. Who selects them? A study of the career trajectories of many of those ‘chosen’ shows how they rise to prominence in American life and how their peers ensure these men penetrate the very fabric of important US institutions. They are always there in key positions during war and peace, manipulating and watching ceaselessly.

&gt;The influence of the Elite families on the thought processes of nations is carried out through academic institutions and organisations, as well as the media. Sutton writes:

&gt;*Among academic associations the American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the American Psychological Association were all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order. These are key associations for the conditioning of society. The phenomenon of The Order as the FIRST on the scene is found especially among Foundations, although it appears that The Order keeps a continuing presence among Foundation Trustees… The FIRST Chairman of an influential but almost unknown organisation established in 1910 was also a member of The Order. In 1920 Theodore Marburg founded the American Society for the Judicial Settlement of Disputes, but Marburg was only President. The FIRST Chairman was member William Howard Taft. The Society was the forerunner of the League to Enforce Peace, which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately the United Nations.*

&gt;The United Nations is an instrument of the Elite designed to facilitate the setting up of One World Government under Elite control. The UN building stands on Rockefeller property.

&gt;**Selecting Future Prime Ministers to Serve the New World Order**

&gt;In his article, ‘Oxford University – The Illuminati Breeding Ground’, David Icke recounts an incident that demonstrates how these secret societies and groups, working for the Elite, select, train and plan to install their men in key positions. In 1940 a young man addressed a “study group” of the Labor Party in a room at University College Oxford. He stressed that he belonged to a secret group without a name which planned a “Marxist takeover” of Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa by infiltrating the British Parliament and Civil Services. Since the British do not like extremists they dismiss their critics as ‘right-wingers’ while themselves posing as ‘moderates’ (this seems like the anti-Semitism charge by ADL, etc. whenever Israel is criticised). The young man stated that he headed the political wing of that secret group and he expected to be made Prime Minister of Britain some day! The young man was Harold Wilson who became Prime Minister of Britain (1964-70, 1974-76)!

&gt;All young men studying at Ivy League universities, and at others, must bear in mind they are being continually scrutinised by some of their Professors with the intention of selecting from amongst them, those who will serve the Elite, and become part of a global network of interlocked covert and overt societies and organisations, working for the New World Order. Some of those already selected will be present among them, mingling with them and yet, in their heart, separated from them by a sense of belonging to a brotherhood with a mission that has been going on for a long time. These young men also know they will be rewarded by advancement in career and also that if they falter they could be killed!

&gt;Utter secrecy and absolute loyalty is essential to the continued success of this program. This is enforced through fear of murder or bankruptcy and through a cult which probably takes us back to the times of the pyramids and before. Philosophically ‘they’ believe in Hegelian dialectics through which they justify bringing about horrible wars – euphemistically called ‘controlled conflict’. Their political ideology is ‘collectivism’ whereby mankind has to be ‘managed’ by a group of men, ‘them’, organised for the purpose – a hidden ‘dominant minority’. ‘They’ believe that they know better than ordinary mortals. The Illuminati, the Freemasons, members of other known and unknown secret societies, all mesh together under the wealthiest cabal in human history to take a mesmerised, dormant and battered mankind from one abyss to the next. Former MI6 agent John Coleman refers to a “Committee of 300” that controls and guides this vast subterranean human machinery.

&gt;In his book Memoirs, published in 2002, David Rockefeller, Sr. stated that his family had been attacked by “ideological extremists” for “more than a century… Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterising my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” That’s it!",conspiracy,1519405781,The_In-Betweener,39,196,True,2018-02-23

Anyway, he posted this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP5Y1y3Hmsg

He basically tells the audience about the basic stuff like how illuminati control everything, but towards the middle-end, he kind of breaks out, and starts ranting about how theres satanic sacrifices and pedophilia at youtube events at 3 am etc.

Youtube supposedly deleted a lot of his videos exposing what goes on, and gave him a channel strike.

What's interesting is, i looked at his twitter, and he said his manager/agent called him stating that youtube would like to have an in-person talk with him at their building.

What do you think they will want with him? Couldnt they just terminate his channel if they wanted to, why summon him?

99,Einstein's Theory of Relativity,"Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been used to explain away a lot of observable and even scientifically testable phenomenon, particularly as it relates to the nature of this place - up to and including the size and shape of the Earth.  At the core of this theory is the notion that space-time is a type of fabric bent by mass.  All of this, of course, is a theory, but I wanted to punch holes in this theory by pointing out that if space-time really is a fabric of sorts then the movements of all mass should act upon this fabric.  It does, you say?  Really?

I would like to point out that things are supposedly constantly moving and exploding in outer space.  If there is constant changes or fluctuations in mass, wouldn't that result in large space-time waves of some sort (i.e. places where time speeds up and slows down in waves)?  Even large gravitational waves, perhaps?  No.  The scientific community has concluded that even gravitational waves are far too small to cause problems.  In fact, they are so small that they can barely be ""detected"".  Detection is a fantastical art using two lasers (LIGO).  Yes, you heard that right.  While scientists do not even know what gravity is, they are supposedly able to generate it enough to test their equipment that measures the very thing they do not understand (e.g. look ma, I created a boofong measuring device to test for boofongs, and, even though I have no idea what a boofong is, I have collaborated the equipment to test for boofongs and found one!).  Supposedly, they measured a single gravitational wave signal.  Yep, out of all of the gravitational waves supposedly bouncing around out there they ""detected"" a clear very signal from a single gravitational wave.  They even won awards for their 'findings'.

Now, I am going to call bullshit on the Theory of Relativity and these finding.  For if space-time were a fabric, it would bunch up before the procession of each large mass and become thinner as the mass moves.  Space-time would eventually become very thin as large masses make repeated orbits resulting in time distortions.  Explosions, even explosions here on Earth, should cause distortions in the space-time fabric.  If you say this does not happen because space-time is somehow thinner outside of the Earth, than this would mean that time runs slower outside of the gravitation field of Earth according to this theory.  Additionally, if space-time were a fabric, large events should create large distortions.  Essentially, gravitational waves along with other waves from space should create the occasional time distortion here on Earth.  You do not see this, nor has this been observed in any meaningful way.

My background is not in science.  However, I did read Einstein's book.  If there are distortions in space-time, I believe these would be evident and experienced here on a larger scale.  Modern science really has failed to explain the obvious lack of trans-dimensional weather here on Earth, which would be required to maintain the theory of relativity.",conspiracy,1519413455,J0e_EE,21,0,True,2018-02-23

143,I would like to introduce this sub the the cartoon that got me into conspiracy theories (Links Provided),"Disclaimer: This is not a conspiracy but just something of a lighter note that I want to share with the rest of this sub.


I have been an active member of this year for about 2.5 years, but I have been into conspiracies and alternative histories for 20 years.

 My introduction to these concepts did not come from a book or documentary, but a cartoon better known as The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest (1996). For those that who may not know but this was reboot of earlier 60s cartoon produced by Hanana- Barbara. In both shows, they follow a family of adventures that deal with cryptozoology, the paranormal, extra-terrestrials, and beyond. What makes the 90s show standout to me is that they explored conspiracies and ideas that may have some merit, such as:


The government leaves its agents in the field and lets them die if they are compromised.

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5sbpld 

Private companies developing microchips for controlling human emotion
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6ck1bt 

And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Like I said, watching this show as a kid helped me to at least consider other possibilities and probably made me an avid pursuer of conspiracies. In its own right it’s a good, incredibly underrated cartoon worth watching. If you have any questions regard it, feel free to ask.

168,The Media And Propaganda,"It's astonishing to me that most people fail to realize that the goal of the mainstream media oftentimes is to divide and conquer the masses. It's fascinating to me that people can't sit back and realize that the media is akin to a window that looks out onto the outside world—you control the media and you control what people *see* and *think* and *believe*. Without the media the masses would be blind to the world around them.

Open up the websites to many prominent major newspapers and you will read headlines that don't inform the individual reader on just the bare facts but push and paint a narrative. The line between reporting just the facts and pushing a narrative has long been blurred. You see it in the NY Times and Washington Post headlines, *telling* the reader what to *think* about any given situation or event, without laying out just the facts. *Tells*. Us. What. To. Think. Pushes. A. Narrative.

Why can't people see this? The media has done its job the last year because anyone seen critical of mainstream news is immediately branded a Trump supporter and ridiculed. It's highly convenient. Why can't the masses understand that the much of the mainstream media is in fact fake news and propaganda and yet Donald Trump really isn't a good person or president? The world isn't black and white.

The media is currently conflating and pushing the Russia-Trump narrative—indictments have been brought this week by Special Counsel Mueller against 13 Russians and the media has been pushing this ""Trump can't call it a hoax any more"" narrative. What did Trump deny? What did Trump call a hoax? Collusion between his campaign in 2016 and the Russian government to hack into the DNC servers and/or release pertinent emails damaging to the Clinton campaign. Have we forgotten that? The indictments of the 13 Russians had nothing to do with collusion. Neither did Manafort's. Neither did Flynn's. Neither did Papadopoulos's. Does stating those facts mean Trump is a good president? No.

[Take this, for example. BEFORE the recent Nunes' memo was even released the NY Times editorial board wrote this as a headline.](https://vgy.me/pH1gKR.png) [Under that headline? This.](https://vgy.me/nT8VjX.png) It literally reads like biased tabloid journalism.

We have people believing that between Obama leaving office and Trump entering office that suddenly the country turned on a dime and white supremacists are everywhere and that you should be scared. Who gave Richard Spencer, for example, attention? Why do we even know his name? Because the mainstream news has pushed him and has interviewed him constantly after the election. Why? Ask yourself that. Are there racists in the US? Yes. Should we be interviewing them on NPR and screaming about them on NY Times and CNN and giving them attention and a platform? The media is **telling** us what to *fear* and be *scared* of. It props up Boogeymen, like Spencer, like Bannon. Any other political junkie here remember when the whole ""Steve Bannon is a white supremacist OMG!"" began? Mere weeks after the election and it was pushed, constantly.Why wasn't this talked about before Trump won? I remember finding a false quote last year in a major magazine—Vanity Fair, I believe—stating that Bannon said that ""Breitbart is a platform for white supremacists"" or something similar and was so astonished about the outright lie that I emailed the writer to tell them the quote was wrong. Then again, I really don't like Bannon.

We have people who call themselves liberals who gloss over or even ignore the DNC rigging the 2016 Democratic primaries against Bernie Sanders yet want to rip their hair out and scream that Trump is illegitimate because the Russian government ""won"" the 2016 election for him. We have liberals suddenly praising the police state and mass surveillance intelligence community. We have liberals befriending and excusing George W. Bush. We have liberals bring forth a new age McCarthyism where anyone can be branded a traitor or collaborator without evidence.

The Russian government used fake ads and bots on Twitter and Facebook? What does that even mean? Aren't Facebook and Twitter private, worldwide companies which anyone or any entity in almost any country can use? What right does the US government have to tell private companies who to do business with on their services? Is buying ads illegal? Was anything actually illegal? What proof have we been shown that the Russian government was involved? IP addresses from within Russian borders? Really? 

If these Twitter bots and Facebook ads were so serious and swayed the election then why has the FBI never independently verified the RUSSIAN hack into the DNC?

People are failing to realize that under the guise of Russian election ""meddling"" that Congress and the government is clamping down on social media and all forms of popular internet communication within the US. It's a convenient way for the government to insert more control, more spying, and overall more power over how the masses freely communicate. It's akin to the Patriot Act where we as citizens had to give up our Constitutional freedoms in order to be ""safer"". 

The rich and elite and corporations use the politicians and the media to control how the masses think.  Yet we don't live in a black and white world where that means someone like Trump is somehow a savior. He isn't. He supported an accused pedophile—9 women accused Roy Moore and 9 women weren't all lying—for political expediency. That, in anyone's eyes, should make Trump a piece of garbage not worthy of the office. The masses shouldn't have to pick sides like this is a game and Republicans and Democrats are akin to sports teams. Both major parties are terrible, much of the media is propaganda and our government—intelligence agencies included—are corrupt. We. Know. This. By. Now.

Yet we continue to fall for the game and let them divide us. 

Why did the news push Trump 24/7 during the 2016 campaign? Ratings. $$$. Why did the news ignore Sanders during the primaries and even run constant hit pieces—looking at you WaPo—on him? Why did the news say Trump had no chance in hell of winning and showed Clinton winning every poll? Why did Anderson Cooper ask after Trump won on election night ""Why would the public ever trust us after this?"" Why are the top Democrats—Schumer and Pelosi—suddenly for many things in Bernie Sander's 2016 agenda that they openly and publicly scorned and joked about a year and a half ago? 

[This is modern day neolibralism at its finest. Ex CIA. A ""Never Trumper"" in 2016 that ran as a Republican alternative to Trump in several states. Lumping Bernie Sanders in with extremists.](https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin/status/964932977447849984)

Why is the media repeatedly whining about Trump attacking the 1st Amendment and the Constitution when it does the same thing with the 2nd Amendment? More people are killed by car accidents every year than death by guns. Ditto with cigarettes. All that whining about the opioid epidemic? Vastly more people are killed by cigarette smoking PER YEAR in the US than via opioids and gun related deaths combined. Actually more people die in ONE YEAR from cigarette smoking in the US than [have been killed by opioids from 1999 to 2016.](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html) Yet I can walk into almost any gas station in the US and buy cigarettes, legally.

Both parties are corrupt. The media is corrupted. We know this yet we all remain apathetic to it. The system itself—low wages, student loan debt, credit card debt, the powers employers have over employees, lack of universal healthcare—is corrupt. The rich get richer and the percentage of the poor becomes larger and even poorer. We live in a misinformation and propaganda state where we are fucked over constantly and told to enjoy it. We are divided along political lines so infighting insues and so we won't pay attention to how we are being fucked over.

184,"""Satoshi Nakamoto"" the mysterious creator of Bitcoin is no other than the CIA","Bitcoin has surged to all time highs,  Who created Bitcoin, and why? 

The creator of Bitcoin is officially a name, “Satoshi Nakamoto” – very few people believe that it was a single male from Japan.  In the early days of Bitcoin development this name is associated with original key-creation and communications on message boards, and then the project was officially handed over to others at which point this Satoshi character never appeared again (Although from time to time someone will come forward saying they are the real Satoshi Nakamoto, and then have their posts deleted).

Bitcoin could very well be the ‘one world currency’ that conspiracy theorists have been talking about for some time.  It’s a kill five birds with one stone solution – not only is Bitcoin an ideal one world currency, it allows law enforcement a perfect record of all transactions on the network.  It states very clearly on bitcoin.org (the official site) in big letters “Bitcoin is not anonymous” :

Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. 



Another advantage of Bitcoin is the problem of Quantitative Easing – the Fed (and thus, nearly all central banks in the world) have painted themselves in a corner, metaphorically speaking.  QE ‘solved’ the credit crisis, but QE itself does not have a solution.  Currently all currencies are in a race to zero – competing with who can print more money faster.  Central Bankers who are in systemic analysis, their economic advisors, know this.  They know that the Fiat money system is doomed, all what you can read online is true (just sensationalized) – it’s a debt based system based on nothing.  That system was created, originally in the early 1900’s and refined during Breton Woods followed by the Nixon shock (This is all explained well in Splitting Pennies).  In the early 1900’s – there was no internet!  It is a very archaic system that needs to be replaced, by something modern, electronic, based on encryption.  Bitcoin!  It’s a currency based on ‘bits’ – but most importantly, Bitcoin is not the ‘one world currency’ per se, but laying the framework for larger cryptocurrency projects.  In the case of central banks, who control the global monetary system, that would manifest in ‘Settlement Coin’ :

Two resources available almost exclusively to central banks could soon be opened up to additional users as a result of a new digital currency project designed by a little-known startup and Swiss bank UBS.  One of those resources is the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system used by central banks (it’s typically reserved for high-value transactions that need to be settled instantly), and the other is central bank-issued cash.  Using the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) unveiled today, the five-member consortium that has sprung up around the project aims to help central banks open-up access to these tools to more customers. If successful, USC has the potential to create entirely new business models built on instant settling and easy cash transfers.  In interview, Robert Sams, founder of London-based Clearmatics, said his firm initially worked with UBS to build the network, and that BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, ICAP and Santander are only just the first of many future members.

the NSA/CIA often works for big corporate clients, just as it has become a cliche that the Iraq war was about big oil, the lesser known hand in global politics is the banking sector.  In other words, Bitcoin may have very well been ‘suggested’ or ‘sponsored’ by a banker, group of banks, or financial services firm.  But the NSA (as we surmise) was the company that got the job done.  And probably, if it was in fact ‘suggested’ or ‘sponsored’ by a private bank, they would have been waiting in the wings to develop their own Bitcoin related systems or as in the above “Settlement Coin.”  So the NSA made Bitcoin – so what?


The FX markets currently represent the exchange between ‘major’ and ‘minor’ currencies.  In the future, why not too they will include ‘cryptocurrencies’ – we’re already seeing the BTC/EUR pair popup on obscure brokers.  When BTC/USD and BTC/EUR are available at major FX banks and brokers, we can say – from a global FX perspective, that Bitcoin has ‘arrived.’  Many of us remember the days when the synthetic “Euro” currency was a new artificial creation that was being adopted, although the Euro project is thousands of degrees larger than the Bitcoin project.  But unlike the Euro, Bitcoin is being adopted at a near exponential rate by demand (Many merchants resisted the switch to Euros claiming it was eating into their profit margins and they were right!).

And to answer the question as to why Elite E Services is not actively involved in Bitcoin  the answer is that previously, you can’t trade Bitcoin.  Now we’re starting to see obscure brokers offering BTC/EUR but the liquidity is sparse and spreads are wacky – that will all change.  When we can trade BTC/USD just like EUR/USD you can bet that EES and a host of other algorithmic FX traders will be all over it!  It will be an interesting trade for sure, especially with all the volatility, the cross ‘pairs’ – and new cryptocurrencies.  For the record, for brokers- there’s not much difference adding a new symbol (currency pair) in MT4 they just need liquidity, which has been difficult to find.

So there’s really nothing revolutionary about Bitcoin, it’s just a logical use of technology in finance considering a plethora of problems faced by any central bank who creates currency.  And there are some interesting caveats to Bitcoin as compared to major currencies; Bitcoin is a closed system (there are finite Bitcoin) – this alone could make such currencies ‘anti-inflationary’ and at the least, hold their value (the value of the USD continues to deteriorate slowly over time as new M3 introduced into the system.)  But we need to pay


Here’s some interesting theories about who or whom is Satoshi:

A corporate conglomerate   

Some researchers proposed that the name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ was derived from a combination of tech companies consisting of Samsung, Toshiba, Nakayama, and Motorola. The notion that the name was a pseudonym is clearly true and it is doubtful they reside in Japan given the numerous forum posts with a distinctly English dialect.

Craig Steven Wright

This Australian entrepreneur claims to be the Bitcoin creator and provided proof.  But soon after, his offices were raided by the tax authorities on ‘an unrelated matter’

Soon after these stories were published, authorities in Australia raided the home of Mr Wright. The Australian Taxation Office said the raid was linked to a long-running investigation into tax payments rather than Bitcoin.
Questioned about this raid, Mr Wright said he was cooperating fully with the ATO.
“We have lawyers negotiating with them over how much I have to pay,” he said.

Other potential creators

Nick Szabo, and many others, have been suggested as potential Satoshi – but all have denied it:

The New Yorker published a piece pointing at two possible Satoshis, one of whom seemed particularly plausible: a cryptography graduate student from Trinity College, Dublin, who had gone on to work in currency-trading software for a bank and published a paper on peer-to-peer technology. The other was a Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, Vili Lehdonvirta. Both made denials.
Fast Company highlighted an encryption patent application filed by three researchers – Charles Bry, Neal King and Vladimir Oks­man – and a circumstantial link involving textual analysis of it and the Satoshi paper which found the phrase “…computationally impractical to reverse” in both. Again, it was flatly denied.

THE WINNER: It was the NSA

The NSA has the capability, the motive, and the operational capacity – they have teams of cryptographers, the biggest fastest supercomputers in the world, and they see the need.  Whether instructed by their friends at the Fed, in cooperation with their owners (i.e. Illuminati banking families), or as part of a DARPA project – is not clear and will never be known (unless a whistleblower comes forward).  In fact, the NSA employs some of the best mathematicians and cryptographers in the world.  Few know about their work because it’s a secret, and this isn’t the kind of job you leave to start your own cryptography company.

But the real smoking Gun, aside from the huge amount of circumstantial evidence and lack of a credible alternative, is the 1996 paper authored by NSA “HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH”



The NSA was one of the first organizations to describe a Bitcoin-like system. About twelve years before Satoshi Nakamotopublished his legendary white paper to the Metzdowd.com cryptography mailing list, a group of NSA information security researchers published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash in two prominent places, the first being an MIT mailing list and the second being much more prominent, The American Law Review 

The paper outlines a system very much like Bitcoin in which secure financial transactions are possible through the use of a decentralized network the researchers refer informally to as a Bank. They list four things as indispensable in their proposed network: privacy, user identification (protection against impersonation), message integrity (protection against tampering/substitution of transaction information – that is, protection against double-spending), and nonrepudiation (protection against later denial of a transaction – a blockchain!).


It is evident that SHA-256, the algorithm Satoshi used to secure Bitcoin, was not available because it came about in 2001. However, SHA-1 would have been available to them, having been published in 1993.

Why would the NSA want to do this?  One simple reason: Control.  

As we explain in Splitting Pennies – Understanding Forex – the primary means the US dominates the world is through economic policy, although backed by bombs.  And the critical support of the US Dollar is primarily, the military.  The connection between the military and the US Dollar system is intertwined inextricably.  There are thousands of great examples only one of them being how Iraq switched to the Euro right before the Army’s invasion. 

In October 2000 Iraq insisted on dumping the US dollar – ‘the currency of the enemy’ – for the more multilateral euro.  The changeover was announced on almost exactly the same day that the euro reached its lowest ebb, buying just $0.82, and the G7 Finance Ministers were forced to bail out the currency. On Friday the euro had reached $1.08, up 30 per cent from that time.

Almost all of Iraq’s oil exports under the United Nations oil-for-food programme have been paid in euros since 2001. Around 26 billion euros (£17.4bn) has been paid for 3.3 billion barrels of oil into an escrow account in New York.  The Iraqi account, held at BNP Paribas, has also been earning a higher rate of interest in euros than it would have in dollars.

The point here is there are a lot of different types of control.  The NSA monitors and collects literally all electronic communications; internet, phone calls, everything.  They listen in even to encrypted voice calls with high powered microphones, devices like cellphones equipped with recording devices (See original “Clipper” chip).  It’s very difficult to communicate on planet Earth in private, without the NSA listening.  So it is only logical that they would also want complete control of the financial system, including records of all electronic transactions, which Bitcoin provides.

Could there be an ‘additional’ security layer baked into the Blockchain that is undetectable, that allows the NSA to see more information about transactions, such as network location data?  It wouldn’t be so far fetched, considering their past work, such as Xerox copy machines that kept a record of all copies made (this is going back to the 70’s, now it’s common).  Of course security experts will point to the fact that this layer remains invisible, but if this does exist – of course it would be hidden.

More to the point about the success of Bitcoin – its design is very solid, robust, manageable – this is not the work of a student.  Of course logically, the NSA employs individuals, and ultimately it is the work of mathematicians, programmers, and cryptographers – but if we deduce the most likely group capable, willing, and motivated to embark on such a project, the NSA is the most likely suspect.  Universities, on the other hand, didn’t product white papers like this from 1996.

Another question is that if it was the NSA, why didn’t they go through more trouble concealing their identity?  I mean, the internet is rife with theories that it was in fact the NSA/CIA and “Satoshi Nakamoto” means in Japanese “Central Intelligence” – well there are a few answers for this, but to be congruent with our argument, it fits their profile.

Where could this ‘hidden layer’ be?  Many think it could be in the public SHA-256, developed by NSA (which ironically, was the encryption algorithm of choice for Bitcoin – they could have chosen hundreds of others, which arguably are more secure):

Claims that the NSA created Bitcoin have actually been flung around for years. People have questioned why it uses the SHA-256 hash function, which was designed by the NSA and published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). The fact that the NSA is tied to SHA-256 leads some to assume it’s created a backdoor to the hash function that no one has ever identified, which allows it to spy on Bitcoin users.

“If you assume that the NSA did something to SHA-256, which no outside researcher has detected, what you get is the ability, with credible and detectable action, they would be able to forge transactions. The really scary thing is somebody finds a way to find collisions in SHA-256 really fast without brute-forcing it or using lots of hardware and then they take control of the network,” cryptography researcher Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University said in a previous interview.

Then there’s the question of “Satoshi Nakamoto” – if it was in fact the NSA, why not just claim ownership of it?  Why all the cloak and dagger?  And most importantly, if Satoshi Nakamoto is a real person, and not a group that wants to remain secret – WHY NOT come forward and claim your nearly $3 Billion worth of Bitcoin (based on current prices).

Did the NSA create Satoshi Nakamoto? 

The CIA Project, a group dedicated to unearthing all of the government’s secret projects and making them public, hasreleased a video claiming Bitcoin is actually the brainchild of the US National Security Agency.

The video entitled CIA Project Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin a CIA or NSA project? claims that there is a lot of compelling evidences that proves that the NSA is behind Bitcoin. One of the main pieces of evidence has to do with the name of the mysterious man, woman or group behind the creation of Bitcoin, “Satoshi Nakamoto”.

According to the CIA Project, Satoshi Nakamoto means “Central Intelligence” in Japanese. Doing a quick web search, you’ll find out that Satoshi is usually a name given for baby boys which means “clear thinking, quick witted, wise,” while Nakamoto is a Japanese surname which means ‘central origin’ or ‘(one who lives) in the middle’ as people with this surname are found mostly in the Ryukyu islands which is strongly associated with the Ry?ky? Kingdom, a highly centralized kingdom that originated from the Okinawa Islands. So combining Nakamoto and Satoshi can be loosely interpreted as “Central Intelligence”.

Is it so really hard to believe?  This is from an organization that until the Snowden leaks, secretly recorded nearly all internet traffic on the network level by splicing fiber optic cables.  They even have a deep-sea splicing mission that will cut undersea cables and install intercept devices.  Making Bitcoin wouldn’t even be a big priority at NSA.


Certainly, anonymity is one of the biggest myths about Bitcoin. In fact, there has never been a more easily traceable method of payment. Every single transaction is recorded and retained permanently in the public “blockchain”.  The idea that the NSA would create an anarchic, peer-to-peer crypto-currency in the hope that it would be adopted for nefarious industries and become easy to track would have been a lot more difficult to believe before the recent leaks by Edward Snowden and the revelation that billions of phone calls had been intercepted by the US security services. We are now in a world where we now know that the NSA was tracking the pornography habits of Islamic “radicalisers” in order to discredit them and making deals with some of the world’s largest internet firms to insert backdoors into their systems.

And we’re not the only ones who believe this, in Russia they ‘know’ this to be true without sifting through all the evidence.


Nonetheless, Svintsov’s remarks count as some of the more extreme to emanate from the discussion. Svintsov told Russian broadcast news agency REGNUM:“All these cryptocurrencies [were] created by US intelligence agencies just to finance terrorism and revolutions.”Svintsov reportedly went on to explain how cryptocurrencies have started to become a payment method for consumer spending, and cited reports that terrorist organisations are seeking to use the technology for illicit means.

Let’s elaborate on what is ‘control’ as far as the NSA is concerned.  Bitcoin is like the prime mover.  All future cryptocurrencies, no matter how snazzy or functional – will never have the same original keys as Bitcoin.  It created a self-sustained, self-feeding bubble – and all that followed.  It enabled law enforcement to collect a host of criminals on a network called “Silk Road” and who knows what other operations that happened behind the scenes.  Because of pesky ‘domestic’ laws, the NSA doesn’t control the internet in foreign countries.  But by providing a ‘cool’ currency as a tool, they can collect information from around the globe and like Facebook, users provide this information voluntarily.  It’s the same strategy they use like putting the listening device in the chips at the manufacturing level, which saves them the trouble of wiretapping, electronic eavesdropping, and other risky methods that can fail or be blocked.  It’s impossible to stop a cellphone from listening to you, for example (well not 100%, but you have to physically rewire the device).  Bitcoin is the same strategy on a financial level – by using Bitcoin you’re giving up your private transactional information.  By itself, it would not identify you per se (as the blockchain is ‘anonymous’ but the transactions are there in the public register, so combined with other information, which the NSA has a LOT OF – they can triangulate their information more precisely.

That’s one problem solved with Bitcoin – another being the economic problem of QE (although with a Bitcoin market cap of $44 Billion, that’s just another day at the Fed buying MBS) – and finally, it squashes the idea of sovereignty although in a very, very, very subtle way.  You see, a country IS a currency.  Until now, currency has always been tied to national sovereignty (although the Fed is private, USA only has one currency, the US Dollar, which is exclusively American).  Bitcoin is a super-national currency, or really – the world’s first one world currency.

Of course, this is all great praise for the DOD which seems to have a 50 year plan – but after tens of trillions spent we’d hope that they’d be able to do something better than catching terrorists (which mostly are artificial terrorists)",conspiracy,1519430976,PeopleWhoDied,28,22,True,2018-02-23

On September 4th, 2017; my father Tommy Wayne Baird jr was brutally beaten (held down, boot heel prints on each wrist, broken nose, sub dural brain bleeds, bruises all over his body, tased in the neck and chest with no defensive wounds, etc) and killed at the age of 49 by 4 Madison County police officers (of which 15 minutes of the killing was on Facebook live) after passing up a checkpoint and being followed for several miles while on his way to Jackson, Mississippi to get his PTSD medication from the VA clinic. He served two tours in Iraq and medically retired because of his PTSD. My father would never fight police and he did anything and everything for people; he would give you the shirt off his back if that's what it took.

Cliffs: EO 10450 lets executive fire people for whatever secrete reason they have. Navy v. Egan protects executive from explaining a reason why they are keeping something secret even from courts and congress. Obama's last EO 13467 allows people to be put into executive departments that you can never fire if they can prove they have a national security role.

3 days before Trump was pres.

----------------------------

Navy v. Egan: https://www.loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/egan_public_2009.pdf

In Egan, the Supreme Court decided this fundamental issue: “In an appeal pursuant to § 7513, *the Board does not have authority to review the substance of an underlying security-clearance determination in the course of reviewing an adverse action.”59 The dispute was entirely within the executive branch: (Merit System Protection Board) MSPB versus Navy.* The case was argued and decided on statutory grounds, even if parts of the majority decision commented on the President’s powers under Article II. The majority, however, did not find in the President any plenary or unchecked power over classified information.

The majority clearly wrote: *“unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.”* 60 Resolution of disputes over classified information depends on judgments by both of the elected branches, Congress and the President. Moreover, judicial deference to executive judgments does not require congressional deference. Members of Congress have both the authority and the duty to exercise their own powers under Article I.

List of Executive Agencies

**Department of Justice (DOJ)**

**Department of State**

Does this mean that Executive has the power to investigate Executive branch departments, insulated from requirements of other parts of the us legal code, in this case it protected the US Navy from admitting to the substance of the case using the requirements of 5 U.S. Code § 7701?

In the appellate courts, a dissenting opinion discussed executive order 10450 https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10450.html 

To him, the protection of classified information “is an executive responsibility flowing from the President’s constitutional mandate to provide for the national defense."" 

which *was repealed by Obama's final executive order* https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-23/pdf/2017-01623.pdf which he signed January 17th 2017.

Section 3 of Executive Order 13467 is revised to read as follows:
‘‘Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Executive Order 13381 of June 27, 2005,
as amended, and Executive Order 10450 of April 27, 1953, as amended,
are revoked. By revoking Executive Order 10450 of April 27, 1953, as amended,
**there is no intent to alter the requirement for an investigation for national**
**security purposes or the ‘‘clearly consistent with the interest of national**
**security’’ standard prescribed by that Executive Order *for making the determinations***
***referenced in section 2.7(b)(ii)*.** Further, suitability, fitness,
credentialing, and national security eligibility regulations, standards and
guidance issued by, or interagency agreements entered into by, the Council,
the Executive Agents, or any agency pursuant to Executive Order 10450
of April 27, 1953, as amended, shall remain valid until superseded.

‘‘(ii) **establish and maintain within their respective agencies, an effective program to ensure that employment and retention of any covered individual within the agency is clearly consistent with the interests of national security and, as applicable, meets standards for eligibility for access to classified information** or to hold a sensitive position, suitability, fitness, or credentialing, established by the respective Executive Agent; 

I think Obama was scared of Trump going after the DoJ and the State Dept. I also think this can be used to permanently defend Mueller from Trump until this executive order is further revised by Trump. ",conspiracy,1519442275,crackercider,4,13,True,2018-02-23

239,The Soviet Cult of Childhood,"“…We need that generation of young people who began to reach political maturity in the midst of a disciplined and desperate struggle against the bourgeoisie. In this struggle that generation is training genuine Communists; it must subordinate to this struggle, and link up with it, each step in its studies, education, and training.”

-V.I. Lenin, Tasks of the Youth Leagues (Bourgeois and Communist Morality)

Children in the Soviet Union held a special place in the hearts of citizens and the Party. They represented not only the innocence of youth, but also the promise of the socialist future; in order for the international Marxist Revolution to succeed, the youth had to be treated well and educated politically. Communist authorities took many routes to achieve this goal. 

The Communist Party formalized this cult through youth organizations such as the Komsomol, Young Pioneers, and Little Octobrists.

Much as Lenin did in his 1920 speech to the Komsomol, this cult relied on a juxtaposition between “true” Communist children and everyone else. By institutionalizing this reverence for childhood, the Communist Party isolated those children who did not join such groups, and were in fact able to create a radical other, or class enemy.

Rather than attach themselves most strongly to their families, Soviet children were taught to prioritize Communism above all, and these youth organizations provided the very first encounters with socialism. This had the significant effect of diminishing the role of the family structure, and these groups became the primary outlet for self-expression among Soviet children.

If you add this video to the enterprise all area command (paid to hear) police scanner from oct 1st things start to add up..

Enterprise all area command confirming shots on those floors (area from first video) and marilou in custody Oct 1 (I don't remember the exact video but here's a link to the channel with the paid scanner (free) and they do confirm shooting on many other floors. One being 4 seasons 32 and 23.. You might just have to dig the video up or ask the page owner what video it's in. It is a police scanner MLD related recent video iirc. Here's the scanner page

https://youtu.be/r-nkoq7ws3A


Add this too add even more suspect..

https://www.intellihub.com/a-total-of-10-windows-were-knocked-out-of-mandalay-bay-the-night-of-the-shooting/

Enterprises all area command confirms shooting on floor 23(campos),32,61 (that's 41) and a few other floors I can't recall off the top of my head. The scanner we all heard was just a coverup. The real scanner was paid to hear. Not many knew of apparently.

They confirm finding MLD'S SUV BY PLATE across from MB and ask for tow.(while a woman screams help in background) the police also say she struggled and was having trouble walking. 
First time we see MLD she's in a wheelchair. 

 The public was told her suv was found in a whole different place. One of paddocks house. Highly recommended watching all 3 videos (sorry idk what enterprise scanner is the one confirming the shots fired in 4 seasons,32 and 23 but it IS THERE.) For some reason 4 season does NOT want involved in this horrific crime even if it means solving it...unless they already have. 

Paddock had a room on floor 61=41 I can't recall if it was 41-10 or 41-15. This is a lot of info about a lone wolf. Don't forget his rooms at the ogden too. Also the fact he was poisoned according to autopsy. (8 cell phones 23 guns 5k ammo...)

These victims family's deserve truth and we do too. This shouldn't be brushed under the rug because tourist revenue and MGM stock.
Btw MGM CEO dumped 80% of his shares before the shooting and then he bought them back when price dipped,after the shooting. Even if the dip was small.. 80% of MGM IS A HUGE PROFIT when stocks stabalize. I also believe the CEO of MGM selling off 80% of his shares is suspect.

266,A theory in progress - land ownership and the coming socioeconomic shift,"I've been working on a concept for some time, but it's not complete. I want to put it out there and see what others think about the current climate and the logical conclusion of the current climate of social and economic situations in the world generally and the United States specifically.

It begins with the basic idea that ownership is being removed from us. We are being gradually denied the ability to own things. Music, movies, soon our own hard drives are being replaced with cloud solutions. Mortgage restrictions leave millions of us renting -  dumping money into something we never own.

As we're being squeezed out of ownership, we're being squeezed out of legitimate say. Those who own dictate the laws those of us that borrow must follow.

This situation is untenable. It will reach a dramatic tipping point as it has in other societies. History teaches one sound lesson above all others - we have a great deal in common with snakes. When cornered, we will lash out and cause harm.

At this point, ownership of anything is difficult but ownership of land is still something of a possibility - there are some areas where land is still reasonable. I believe this will not be the case for much longer. I believe people who are not attempting to secure land are volunteering themselves to this inevitable future of perpetual servitude. 

Land ownership can be taken away, don't get me wrong. But to take land requires state, county, local legislation that has not completely eroded. Yes the Supreme Court paved the way for [peoples land to be taken from underneath their feet](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2015/06/29/the-supreme-court-decision-that-threatened-justices-own-homes), but they can't do so easily. Yet.

My solution for the time being is land ownership. I believe it is crucial for more like-minded individuals to be a part of this process. Make no mistake, this is not a guarantee or even a good chance at avoiding the consequences or the tipping point I mentioned previously. But it's a chance.

When things break, and they are going to break, there will be a great deal of social upheaval. As the bottom of the ladder begins to lose stability the top must come down harder to maintain its own position. This is physics. This is also politics. 

The more the ""have nots"" begin to shake the ladder, the more the ""have everythings"" will apply force and weight to maintain their position. They can manipulate so much from their position - but as of now, they can't fully manipulate land ownership.

Again, this is a working theory but one I am personally invested in. I believe others should do the same. It won't be long before time tells whether or not I'm right. If I'm wrong, the worst case scenario - I own land. If I'm correct, then I have something that will not be possible for future generations.",conspiracy,1519449184,SixVISix,25,27,True,2018-02-24

Now if the first girl is factual then that means N decided not to shoot her. Which adds a new layer to this story. The second shooter must have been friends with N or was a handler or was another student who wanted to plan the perfect school shooting or take them to the next level.

As N had an exit strategy.

Did other students interact with the Shooters?

I think the most interesting part is when he mentions the rapper called Kasinova Tha Don sounding just like Tupac. I've always been interested in Tupac conspiracy theories but this is one i've never head before. Kasinova Tha Don's voice sounds literally identical to tupac, in my opinion. Here's a link to one of his songs released in 2012: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOVeJ8UoWI

That voice is unmistakeble. And the first line of the of the song says ""it's been 16 years."" ...2012-16= 1996 (the year Tupac was shot). Kasinova also says in the song ""9-7-96, I remember like it was yesterday, I got a lot to say"" ....9/7/96 was the day Tupac was shot. I find this theory pretty interesting and decided to share to take a break from all of the school shooting and political posts for a moment

EDIT: a couple of other lines from the Kasinova song: 
1)""i cant believe what i'd happen to see, a nigga who looked just like me""﻿ (body double?)
2) ""The media said that i died but im still breathing""﻿

312,Til we have a civilian and military flag.,"https://imgur.com/a/EZuFL

I appreciate everything veterans are doing and have done,I think it's HORRIBLE the way some VETS are treated. I'm curious to why our children are pledging alledgence to an American military complex flag from day one?

I'm almost 30 and tried to sign up for the army after 911 and was denied (thank god) because I don't believe in why we went to war now except the terrorism part. 

There was much more to it than that though..the pipeline americans proposed to OBL days before he managed to have 2 planes fly into 2 towers that made 3 fall into thier own footprints. You can guess he denied and wanted his territory to himself. The fact military bases an soldiers were made to guard poppy fields because when OBL denied involvement with 911 the ""taliban"" started burning poppy fields. (Makes you wonder how that hurts the us government?)

https://imgur.com/a/Uzopo
(2001 is the low year if you can't see it)

We found a trillion + dollar lithium mine while there and we sure killed anyone who got in the way of that pipeline and managed to get it done. I don't agree with this. OBL last words I seen on tv ""your own government is playing an elaborate trick on you"" 

So I'm going to fly my civilian flag bc I do support being ready for war. I do support keeping the country safe. I do support fighting terrorism but nasa's budget this year was 19.1b that's .08% decrease from last year. What have we done?

Maybe we can take some money,get it in a pool and fix our infinistructure as far as making schools safer,sheriff stationed that will actually react at tragedy. Every new school built the architect keeps in mind how to make it safe instead of cheap to skim the extra off the top.

321,The real Collision of the 2016 election.,"When ctr fell through because they were exposed they started putting all the funds into shareblue to Continue their propaganda campaign.

The crazy thing to me is that.

On one hand you have donald trump and these supposed Russian bots. Except it wasn't Russian bots it was just ads on Facebook that were sponsored by Russians. But the crazy thing about that is, it wasn't just ads for donald it was ads against him, it was ads for bernie and Jill stein even and cant forget the  pro/anti hrc ads. So yet that concludes it's impossible that these ads were funded by djt because why the fuck would he spend money on boosting other candidates. Regardless what you think of trump he does have a massive ego and the only ego he will stroke is his own. Thats not a dis to him it's just his personality and there's nothing wrong with thinking you're better then everyone as long as you're not a straight up cunt about it.
So yet I am still not seeing any evidence that trump ""colluded"" with Russia to win the election. After this amount of time there's still nothing to corroborate this and there never will be.

And on the other hand, there's full records of payments and such that ctr was very real it existed and people were literally being paid money to spread an opinion through out the internet by social media and other platforms to specifically sway people's opinions therefore swinging the election in to we All know who's favour.

What's even crazier is there's factual evidence that hrc was in charge of the dncs finances even before the election started, money is what runs the machines and if you control the money you for sure control what the machine does down to the t.

And lets not forgot it wasn't just ctr shilling it was cnn msnbc cbs, late night talk shows, tv shows, literally all of the media minus fox was shilling for one candidate. That's what collusion looks like and the tactic goes. Accuse the other party of what your guilty of doing so the spot light isn't on you the spot lights on them for the acts you committed.

Remember she had a 98 percent chance of winning and a billion dollar campaign. And yet after all that she still lost, and to this day won't even 1 percent blame her self for that loss. So if any one thinks trump has a massive ego, they are blind to the fact hrc has an even bigger ego and is a massive cunt to any one other the  herself or others that she can use to get what she wants.

324,Metal,"I’ve been dwelling on metal lately, like, think about what it represents alchemically. Iron, fire, warfare, prison, hard, unbreakable, etc. 

So, if we’re breathing in microscopic pieces of metal, and injecting pieces of metal into our bodies with vaccinations that can’t be good can it? 

My theory regarding these connections is based on the electrical universe and goes along with the inventions of Tesla. If everything is electricity, and it’s all around us, then pumping the very air we breathe with conductive metals would be a powerful tool of control. Make it worse by vaccinations? It’s too late for me, I’m vaccinated. But you can avoid them, for now, and I suggest you do. 

It’s hard to imagine because even in my experience I’ve never come across a scientist or a pilot who will admit to chem trailing but even to the simplest of minds it should be clear that something isn’t right with the skies. 

So what do you think the purpose is? 

Mind control? 

Is it a death machine? Perhaps they could charge the atmosphere and simply kill everyone?

Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut maybe of more relevance today because of astonishing rape-allegations that came out in 2017 from concerning Hollywood top brass.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ng5nk/in_eyes_wide_shut_kubrick_has_hinted_about_secret/)

A recent thread : [“Stanley told me the world is run by pedophiles,” Nicole Kidman said. “He studied secret societies his whole life, he was fascinated by them, and he said the elite, the top secret societies, they are full of men with a certain predilection. They are tied together, sort of bonded, by pedophilia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zsmvx/stanley_told_me_the_world_is_run_by_pedophiles/)  

------ 

“Stanley told me the world is run by pedophiles,” Nicole Kidman said while promoting HBO’s Big Little Lies, in Los Angeles. “He studied secret societies his whole life, he was fascinated by them, and he said the elite, the top secret societies, they are full of men with a certain predilection. They are tied together, sort of bonded, by pedophilia.

“They all know each other’s dark secrets. There is no way out for any of them. It’s a lifetime bond. Even if one of them wanted to go straight, repent, so to speak, he can’t. His peers will bring him down. They are in it until death, driving the world to ruin. That’s kind of how Stanley explained it but it was all very complex. I’m probably not doing it justice.”

The 1999 film, starring Kidman and her then husband Tom Cruise, was Stanley Kubrick’s last outing as director before his death the same year. Many people believe Kubrick gave away too many secrets in the film about secret societies and the global elite, and it may have cost him his life.

Asked if Kubrick’s knowledge of secret societies and their darkest secrets had anything to do with his death, Kidman raised an eyebrow and said “That’s not a question I can answer here.”

“Though maybe I could. None of you in the media would be allowed to print it, would you? The men who own your companies wouldn’t allow it to get out,” Kidman said.

David Hogg, who has been featured front and center for the unconstitutional gun control teenage advocacy movement rhetoricized by select victims of the Florida school shooting and heavily promoted by the mainstream media, has a father, Kevin Hogg, who is a former FBI agent of 14 years and now works for a global defense contracting company called Cubic.

As you can see from the link, Cubic specializes in a number of disciplines, the most interesting being ""unconventional warfare"" and ""special operations"" training. 

For those that don't know what unconventional warfare is, Wikipedia, a publication heavily edited by the United States Military, defines it's general objective this way: 

""The general objective of unconventional warfare is to instill a belief that peace and security are not possible without compromise or concession."" 

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_warfare)

The article goes on to explain: 

""Unconventional warfare targets civilian populations psychologically to win hearts and minds ... seeking to render the military proficiency of the enemy irrelevant ... Special Forces ... are used unconventionally to train, equip, and advise locals who oppose their government. They can also spread subversion and propaganda, while they aid native resistance fighters, to ultimately cause a hostile government to capitulate ... The Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force ...

424,"Naomi ""Sexy Cyborg"" Wu is a fake","Many of you have probably seen posts and [pictures](https://imgur.com/DW7TH3P) from the skinny Chinese tech goddess with the big fake boobs and short skirts. She has been featured in multiple magazine articles and has a loyal following on Reddit, where here posts have generated tens of thousands of views. She has been described as a maker, a scientist, a cosplayer, and a bombshell. The only issue is that her persona is a construction of a professional electrical engineer who has been living in China for over a decade.


Naomi ""Sexy Cyborg"" Wu became popular after a few of her posts on Reddit rose to the front page. She had almost everything needed to be a viral star on the Internet. Here was a half-naked Asian woman who was comfortable enough in her body to show off lots of skin. Some of her outfits ranged from provocative to outright trashy, even by China standards. Anyone with good Google skills can do a search for her to find photos that leave very little to the imagination.


[Classy](https://imgur.com/JQ4tnMJ.jpg)



Apart from her scantly-clad body and bolted-on breasts, Sexy Cyborg was also sporting some very unique high-tech accessories that she claimed to design and make all by herself. The combination of her tech know-how and short skirts helped her to become an almost instant sensation.

She has thousands of fans around the world, and has a presence on Twitter, Youtube, Thingiverse. She has submitted interviews to some of the top news agencies in the world and also writes articles for tech blogs like Hackaday, and 3dprintingindustry.

Her story is amazing. She learned English from talking to people online. She learned how to code and used her classmates name to make a great living for herself. She taught herself how to use 3d design software and is an active member of the maker community online. Her workshop looks like it cost thousands of dollars and could belong to someone with a lifetime of experience in the industry. She has videos of herself touring electronics markets in large tech cities located in China, and even shows off some of her tech prowess in her Youtube videos.
She has been called an inspiration to young women, and that is where things get a little rocky.

Naomi ""Sexy Cyborg"" Wu isn't a tech goddess. She is a mascot.

Sexy Cyborg isn't Naomi Wu. It is an online persona created by Wu's boyfriend, who is a seasoned electrical engineer who has used Wu as the face of his operation.


[Who do you think was holding the camera?](https://imgur.com/ANSLQvk.jpg)


Reddit's history can be broken up into different eras. Those of us who have been on board for quite some time have seen users come and go. There was a user who used to frequent come of the 3d-design and China subs pretty often. If you do some digging into the reddit archives you may come across a user that goes by the name of ""timaz."" This reddit user was very active on reddit, and had many posts where he talked about 3d printing, Shenzhen, and electrical engineering in general.


[Why delete such a popular account?](https://imgur.com/Se6KGCK.jpg)


Sometime around Sexy Cyborgs rise to stardom the content on timaz's reddit account was deleted. The content on his account was so popular that it received reddit gold, which is an award given from reddit user to reddit user for submitting quality content. Though not expensive, the award does cost money, so one may wonder why the owner of a popular account would go through and delete all the content.


Fortunately the Internet has a way of remembering.


[It seems timaz was the go to guy for 3d-printing questions](https://imgur.com/9aocr1X.jpg)


[Such a helpful guy](https://imgur.com/Xc4ZIyu.jpg)


[Why spend so much time creating content just to delete it all?](https://imgur.com/qTs4jSJ.jpg)



I quick search for the username returns multiple posts on other sites all talking about 3d printing.


[Live China Long Time](https://imgur.com/X3NHvRR.jpg)


[This content was so good it was linked to by another site](https://imgur.com/ihqOKV4.jpg)


[This guy has a lot of experience huh?](https://imgur.com/YnMLcwp.jpg)


So all of a sudden, this very active member in the China maker community who always posted about 3d-printing, CNC, engineering, and general ""maker"" culture vanishes and in his place appears this busty petite Internet sensation with such an unbelievable story.




Once you start looking at the details it becomes clear that her story is too good to be true. The first red flag to someone familiar with China is just how good her written English skills are. Her presence on reddit includes not only posts, but also responses to questions and comments. She has parlayed her popularity to writing blog posts like the one found [here](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/28/source-parts-on-taobao-an-insiders-guide/) where she shows you how to search for parts on Taobao by using Google Translate(which does not work in China. . And also by giving her opinions on the future of the [3d industry.](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/3d-printing-next-five-years-naomi-wu-aka-sexy-cyborg-108980/)



[Where did I see something about Taobao before?](https://imgur.com/YnMLcwp.jpg)


The grammar and formatting are well beyond a lot of even native English speakers. Wu says she learned English by communicating online, but Internet chatrooms and bbs's aren't known for their correct grammar. Her grammar and syntax are impeccable.
As someone who has also traveled the world and spent a lot of time in China, it is very rare for even the higher educated Chinese citizens to have her command of the English language. Her command of the English language is so great that apparently she even uses software in English.


[This is totally how most people in China use their software](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hFE7dMB8T4Y/WQ44EOjOneI/AAAAAAAAAA8/_5767mPQmAg2EvK1tbKnyj7URVk-__lEACEw/s1600/My_3D_Printer_Workflow%2B%25282%2529.gif)


While we are talking about China. The Chinese government blocks sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. Many Chinese people have never even heard of these sites, much less have their own presence on them. It takes special software to bypass the ""Great Firewall"" of China, so these sites can be accessed, but China has their own alternatives that seem to be enough for most citizens. Reddit isn't even a household name in western countries much less China. So it is strange that Naomi is not only familiar with these sites, but also proficient at using them.
What is also strange is the lack of Chinese posts by Wu. All the technical posts are in English. The few results that return for a search for Wu in Chinese are mostly just photos of her. Strange that she doesn't have the same online presence in her home country as she does in the West.
We are to believe that this self-taught genius knows how to code, use 3d design software, design circuits, film and edit videos, write articles in perfect grammar for English websites, use photography software and cameras to take expertly framed shots, navigate the social media of other countries, sew, and still have time to fly drones and travel around the world. When asked directly how she funds her projects, Sexy Cyborg claims to be such an adept coder that she has made enough money to pay for a workstation that many tinkerers would dream to have.


[How much do you think this stuff cost?](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xv1Xl0J4CNU/WQ4y6zZOmzI/AAAAAAAAAAk/WieotXL9SCIZdFJmA5Gj2G8vjRt5ik1TACLcB/s1600/My_Livingroom_Workshop%2B%25281%2529.gif)

Yet when there is actually a video that shows her getting down to business, the video either conveniently has problems


[I'm going to show you my dope skills right nnnext time.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6idejeYlGsQ/WQ4y1_490cI/AAAAAAAAAAs/VF-7aBdZjnMMftMwbOy92wBjtoFiNXcIgCEw/s1600/My_3D_Printer_Workflow.gif)



or she almost cuts off her fingers.

[She totally has done this before](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NljnsonxIZE/WQ44FPsSf1I/AAAAAAAAABA/SbIqjpm10LQ8U58dVFsRowHcYbWAbGmBwCLcB/s1600/My_3D_Printer_Workflow%2B%25281%2529.gif)

Of course there is a video showing her doing some basic soldering on her YouTube page. Seems like a strange thing to show off for such an advanced tinkerer with [18 unique projects submitted to Thingiverse.](https://www.thingiverse.com/SexyCyborg/designs/page:2)



So you may ask why my panties are all in a bunch about this faker. Well the thing is she is being heralded as some sort of role model and inspiration for women and girls. She is free and happy with her body, and she was able to make something of herself without the help of any man.
Thing is, this is all a lie. She is a mascot for an engineer who has probably been in the industry for more years than Wu has been alive. The massive fake breasts do seem more of something out of a westerners fantasy than something that is common in China. That is probably why she is so unique even in her country, and why locals give her so much attention. You can search around and see the amount of people that pose to take pictures of this specimen.


[Posts and responses to her Twitter account trying to address the fakery are routinely blocked.](https://.imgur.com/NO4U1ce.jpg)


You almost wonder why this pair would go through the troub-


[Oh that's right, free stuff!](https://imgur.com/EvIZw2O.jpg)


Sexy Cyborg looks great. I'm happy she is happy with her body. Any critiques of her on reddit are almost instantly hit by white-knights rising to defend the honor of a stranger. I get it. She probably fulfills a lot of fantasies. If that was all she was doing, I wouldn't have a problem with it.
She is not being honest about her capabilities and who is really pulling the strings behind the scene. There is no content actually showing her do anything that someone under the guidance of a trained engineer couldn't do in front of a camera. She is another examples of what is wrong with the Internet in the modern age. Its not about substance, it is all about clicks. Wu and her boyfriend understand this, and my hat goes off to them for being ahead of the curve.
Just don't tell me this is what passes for inspirational these days.

[Here is an image of the post](https://imgur.com/oyix0yW)

I have lived in China for years, so her story didn't sound legit from my experience. I took the time to watch some of her videos and read some articles that were supposedly written by her, and I was astonished by her level of English and skills. She was just so different than any other person I've met here.

I taught here for a while and was hired by some pretty large companies to help their workers learn English. I worked for a factory affiliated with Apple and was brought in to help their workers learn English. Nobody had written English skills like Naomi - by a longshot.

I watched a few videos because I just couldn't believe it, and when I started questioning things I got a lot of people coming to her defense. A few reached out privately and brought up the name Timaz. 

I did previously do some Internet sleuthing with searches for the username Timaz.

This post came up, and the user was going to share pics and videos of his workshop in Shenzhen. It would have been perfect if his images matched Naomi's, but the content had been deleted. The second link was interesting though because it linked to a website that is still up. The website is focused on 360 panorama video. If you check out Naomi's youtube page, most of her first videos were all 360 panorama videos.

There are many other posts by that username. And the content all talks about Shenzhen, maker community, 3d design, etc. The writing still is of a highly educated American, and there are some similarities with the content in these old posts and with the articles that Naomi ""writes""

http://3dprintboard.com/search.php?searchid=2891297

(you may have to register at this board and search for timaz to see this content)

Besides all this stuff, she just makes references to things found in American culture that even the most educated and well-versed Chinese citizen wouldn't really know or care about. She talks about printing Yoda heads in an article and references the theft of ideas by Edison in another. These just aren't things that most Chinese people know. Most educated people here don't even know that much about their history. It isn't what is taught in their schools. So her claim that she is self-educated about all this stuff just seems outlandish.

https://hackaday.com/author/naomi-wu/

I really find it hard to believe that she afforded her whole lab with her coding abilities, and she learned her written English skills online through chat. I don't follow her or watch any of her new videos, but I just have doubt that she ever answers any real tech questions live in person. I think most of her interviews have been done via email, and most of the other inconsistencies I already documented in the blog post.

I really felt guilty about all the negative responses I got, so I was going to delete the sub and all the posts until I saw someone had it taken down. I dug around for updates and found they had started a Patreon to get money, and this really got me aggravated.

Her pastebin bio states

&gt;*What is your job? I am a web developer. Mostly using Ruby on Rails but transitioning to JS. I primarily do software but I have a little bit of exposure to hardware- Arduino and 3D printing. I am passionate about Open Source. I work at home doing freelance work for overseas companies. None of my clients know about my online persona. I'm keeping it that way until I see what sort of direction things take me and if there are any significant negative repercussions. That being said, coding is becoming increasingly challenging given the Internet access issues we have here in China so I may transition to something else.

https://pastebin.com/V3474kYs
Her new Patreon states:

&gt;Why sponsor me? I don't buy frivolous things or lead any kind of a glamorous lifestyle. Whatever you sponsor it won't be wasted. You can see my lifestyle pretty clearly from my videos- most of my income goes to tools and stuff for my builds, My actual job is web development, I work online and am not the best so can only charge local rates- that means 60hr weeks and not a lot of days off. I'm hoping that some people out there enjoy my content and can afford to help out. So does she work for overseas companies or does she work for local rates.

https://www.patreon.com/sexycyborg

She didn't really get any pushback besides the blog I wrote, so it seems she changed her story from ""I can afford this lifestyle and these tools because of my freelance work"" to ""please give me money because I am a poor Chinese girl who is trying to save the world.""

https://hackaday.com/2017/03/28/source-parts-on-taobao-an-insiders-guide/

How does she know so much about buying stuff in the west? She should not have the frame of reference to compare.

&gt;Don’t Bargain Hunt The “get it cheaper” part is already done with when you made your choice to use TaoBao instead of a distributor back in the West. Further attempts to save money will result in problems. Everyone on Taobao sources from the same factories, if an identical or very similar product is much cheaper there’s a reason for it. Look at the top five most popular listings for a part, the average price of those or higher is what you can expect to pay. While there are certainly challenges to sourcing on TaoBao, for any hardware enthusiast the vast, and frequently customizable selection available make it a very useful resource and skill set to have should the need arise.

It really bothered me that she was being held up as this inspiration for little girls and women. I wouldn't have had any issues if she would just have said that she gets help or that her boyfriend shows her how to do the technical stuff.

The other links I have found on Timaz contain his thoughts and advice on printing and China. There is probably some overlap between his posts as Timaz and ""her"" posts.

The scumbags are now hiding behind SJWs and White Knights if anyone questions her authenticity. If she would have just admitted to working with her boyfriend from the beginning, nobody would have cared. Instead they claimed that she was some self-taught superstar of the maker community, and the big bad men were asking questions about her authenticity just because she was a woman.

425,Finger print that lies,"
(1006.) Finger print that lies (2/23/2018)

 I have no drive license and rare go outside, it's my wife who buys the food. About one year ago, she said she would go Cosco and told me to write down the food list I wanted. Since she did the shopping for a long time and knew what to buy, it was unusual that she needed a list. Anyhow I took a junk mail from the table and wrote on the envelope: ""milk, bread, muffin, egg, banana, orange juice...."". 

At first, I thought it was a trick the Feds needed my hand writing. Connect to events at that time I realized they needed an envelope with my hand writing on it. In September and November of 2016, my wife had been arranged two foreign trips. It never happened before. I thought the Feds was eager to eliminate me. So I gave my valuables to my wife, include my life insurance paper. There were some cash and gift cards(not much, about several hundred dollars), I put them in an empty junk mail envelope. My wife must have shown these things to her handler, that touched the agents' new plan - to put illegal material (fake money or drug) in junk mail envelope because that's my habit and with my hand writing on it. 

In mid 2017, my wife stopped shopping in Cosco for a while. She recovers Cosco shopping recently. But the food I like disappeared. Only two left - egg and milk. I noticed these two also having their package changed. The egg(2 dozen size) now is in a transparent hard plastic box that the cover grip tightly with the bottom, you have to open it with force. 

The milk used to be sold two bottles in a carton. There are open holes at the side board, easy to hold by hands. Now the two bottles are packed tightly by transparent plastic films, it becomes a smooth heavy object with no where to handle. You have to grasp it tightly with hands. 

I remember a story in ""Readers Digest""(Chinese edition, two or three decades ago). I forgot the topic, probably is ""Finger print that lies"". It is about a staff in a Crime Lab framed a case with victim's finger print. He picked up the victim's finger print by glue tape and stick it on the object to prove that man was guilty. 

The new package of egg and milk in Cosco is inconvenient for customer to use but easy to pick up customer's finger print. I think it was particularly re-designed for my case. The purpose is to frame me in a ""criminal"" case with ""hard evidence"". I don't know if they have changed packages of egg and milk in all Costco store because it is inconvenient to handle (milk). Our store is in North San Jose, California.

434,How many homicides can we expect to be prevented by taking away our 2nd amendment right and is the media right for being so focused on it?,"In 2016, a total of 17,250 people were reported killed by homicide. [1]

Of those 17,250 homicides, **only about 11,000 involved a gun.** [2]

------------------

**How many homicides can we expect to be prevented by taking away our 2nd amendment right?** 

Lets do the math:

11,000 gun homicides / 17,250 total homicides = 63% of people who preferred to use a gun to kill their victim. 

That makes 37% of murderers okay with using something other than a gun to murder their victims. 

If guns are banned we can estimate in a best case scenario that 37% of the 11,000 will still go through with the homicide despite not having a gun. That is a theoretical **6,930** lives that will be saved if our 2nd amendment right is completely revoked. This does not take into account the number of deaths, robberies, and rapes that will occur from criminals knowing they can overpower any victim because they know the victim will not be armed. 

Is it worth it to take away our second amendment right over the possibly of saving 2 people out every 100,000 in the best case scenario? 

----------------------------------
**Is the media right for being so focused on it?**
 
Lets compare 11,000 gun deaths to the amount of other preventable early deaths that took place 2016: 

* Drug overdose and Suicide:  **64,070** [4] and **44,193** [3] respectively. Can be significantly avoided with a revamped mental health program. i.e. more therapists in schools and subsidized therapy for adults. 

* Alcohol related deaths from liver disease and accidents/homicides: **19,388** and **30,722** [5] respectively. Hard to prevent this one without outright prohibition but higher taxes and better PSA's can help with this. The media can play a large role with educating people about this. 

* Diabetes: **79,535** [3] 90-95% of which is Type 2 diabetes which is caused by unhealthy eating and a lack of physical activity. Can be greatly reduced with school programs, higher taxes for unhealthy foods, and subsidies for gym memberships and healthy foods.  

* Chronic lower respiratory diseases: **155,041** [3] Can be significantly avoided with a decrease in pollution and tobacco consumption.

Would the media not be more effective in preventing early deaths if they talked more about mental health, unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity, alcohol and tobacco consumption, prescription drug overdoses, and bad air quality? All of which contribute to more early deaths than gun violence.

https://www.npr.org/2015/03/15/393192543/why-is-the-risk-of-youth-suicide-higher-in-rural-areas

Why? According to many sociologists, like Emilie Durkheim, isolation is the answer. As someone who lives in an isolated area, I can relate to this. Still, I do not feel this is just a physical sense of isolation. Social isolation plays a huge role, too.

Loneliness can result in suicide, which is a dark topic that most do not really explore. When one thinks of suicide, one thinks of hopelessness, but what brings someone to such hopelessness?

Sociologist Emile Durkheim found that were three types of suicide: egotistic, altruistic, and anomie. 

For the purpose of this post, I want to focus on anomie, or “a sense of disconnection from society and a feeling of not belonging that result from weakened social cohesion. Anomie occurs during period of serious social, economic, or political upheaval, which results in quick and extreme changes to society and everyday life. In such circumstances a person might feel so confused and disconnected that they choose to commit suicide.”

https://www.thoughtco.com/study-of-suicide-by-emile-durkheim-3026758

Further, according to Durkheim, “it is simply not true that there are “only individuals” in society.”

http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/suicide.html#pgfId=931

Moreover, “Large-scale societal crises may result in heightened suicide rates because the existing social order is challenged. An economic depression, for example, may be accompanied by an increased suicide rate. This is not due, however, to poverty or unemployment specifically but rather a result of a rapid change of conditions, expectations, and individuals' self-regard.”

Whether we like it or not, 99% of us exist within a society, with sociological ramifications. That does not mean that individuality does not exist; rather, there seems to be some type of paradox in thinking that one’s individuality can exist without influence of society. With that being said, people today still like to think that they function on some sort of individuality where society has no influence on their thoughts or paradigms. This concept is simply ridiculous – for the majority of us, we function due to societal influences, unless we are aware of those influences. 

Think about how much our society has changed in the past ten or twenty years. Many of us are experiencing ""anomie.""

So, for the purpose of this post, I want to focus on the social influences that create loneliness, and even contribute to suicide. Further, I want to discuss that this is all purposeful, and as always, there is a conspiracy behind this. ‘They’ want people to feel and be lonely because, ultimately, it breaks down society and cohesion. There is, finally, an inversion of loneliness that ‘they’ try to equate with oneness. Quite simply, people need other people, and technology can not replace real-life human interaction.

**Solitude vs. Isolation**

For the purpose of this post, I want to ensure to differentiate between solitude vs. isolation, or aloneness vs. loneliness.

Solitude is the state or situation of being alone – many like to be alone at times, and there is nothing wrong with that. Being alone can be good for you:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-flux/201410/the-importance-being-alone

We all need alone time, and this post is not in contradiction with that fact.

On the other hand, isolation is defined as being separate from others, and loneliness is defined as sadness because of lack of company. 

All of these definitions can be found on google, so I am not going to link, but the point is that we are living in a society that does not value solitude, and at the same time, there is increased isolation.

What I mean is that we have very little time to actually be alone when we want to be, especially because of the increase of our hectic schedules. People are just too busy:

https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636612-time-poverty-problem-partly-perception-and-partly-distribution-why

When people do finally get that alone time, though, they may ultimately feel lonely or isolated. Today, one of the only ways to feel connected is through social media, and that is making us more lonely than ever. In fact, too much time on social media is directly correlated with loneliness:

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why

So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why? So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why?

**Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs**

Before I write any of these posts, I always call a few of my friends and make sure my arguments hold up. One of my friends had a good argument – he said we do not actually ‘need’ friends.
He’s right, to an extent.

When looking at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, we really only need air, water, food, rest, and health for survival.
But, one could argue that friends are needed for our emotional health, which goes into “security, social, and ego.”

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs

Even an evolutionary biologist can explain why we need others in our lives,

“Friends are important. So important, in fact, that it’s been proven that friendship can extend life expectancy and lower chances of heart disease. Friendship helps us survive. Part of why that is has to do with what happens in our brains when we interact with other humans: a 2011 study detailed the role of the neurobiological endogenous opioid system (the stuff in our brains that make us feel good) in positive social relationships; in 2016, researchers found evidence of the release of oxytocin in primate brains during social interactions; and later that year, psychologists conducted a study that suggested levels of pain tolerance can predict how many friends someone has.”

http://www.thefader.com/2017/03/08/science-of-friendship

Yet, it is almost like we are trained to hate people in today’s society, in some sort of ‘divide and conquer’ tactic, which I will go into more later.

**The Breakdown of Society**

In the past century, specifically due to technology, there has been a breakdown of society, or social interaction. For the purpose this post, I am using Google’s definition of society, which is “the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.”

While most of us live among others, we are feeling more isolated than ever. Why? I know the last time somebody rang my doorbell, I freaked out. Was this type of isolation always normal? Absolutely not.

*Friendships*: 

As noted earlier, we really do need others to feel healthy. Yet, today more than other, people are feeling isolated. Technology has created fake friends, and there is an actual study about this:

http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-friends-are-almost-entirely-fake-study-finds-a6826721.html

*Family*

For many, family is the foundation for which they exist, but the nuclear family is in decline:

http://time.com/3265733/nuclear-family-typical-society-parents-children-households-philip-cohen/

There is no such thing as a ‘typical' family anymore. I am not, however, arguing that atypical families are ‘bad’ but there is also the rise of dysfunctional families:

http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/1-the-american-family-today/

No matter what the media tells you, there are findings that children fare better in traditional, nuclear homes:

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/10/study-children-fare-better-traditional-mom-dad-fam/

From a teacher’s perspective, my students long for both ‘mom’ and ‘dad’, and I’m willing to share those anecdotes if anybody is interested.

*Relationships*

Further, more are having casual sex, and less are willing to be committed in relationships:

https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/casual-sex-everyone-is-doing-it

And less are getting married, and according to this article, that is a good thing:

https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a12787881/decline-of-marrige-wall-street-journal-response/

Media often glorifies casual relationships full of sex, with popular TV shows like Sex in the City, but are people’s needs really fulfilled just through just sex?

https://www.thetrumpet.com/7750-the-emotional-corrosion-of-casual-sex

This article explains how bonding works, and yes, people ‘need’ to feel an intimate bond with people they have sex with. From the article,

“The problem described here also has much deeper and long-lasting effect. The authors report: “Further, there is evidence that when this sex/bonding/breaking-up cycle is repeated a few or many times—even when the bonding was short-lived—damage is done to the important, built-in ability to develop significant and meaningful connection to other human beings.”

Humans crave connection to others, not just physical pleasure.

*Communication*

“It is a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.” – 1984

My students now say “I want to kill myself” as a 'trendy' statement – it has literally lost its meaning and effect. Language is how we connect, and in a controlled society, it loses its value and meaning.

Moreover, while we seem more connected than ever, our level of communication has faced some degradation. For one, people are speaking to each other less:

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophia-a-nelson/when-did-texting-replace-_b_5105265.html

https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/

And even when we do talk, we are not really hearing what the other person says. Echo chambers have been confirmed by science:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.89c796091c56

According to the article, “Users tended to seek out information that strengthened their preferred narratives and to reject information that undermined it.”

So, we are now living in a world where it is so much easier to close off people that may not worship the ground we walk on, as if we are not Gods after all.

*Free Time*

Unfortunately, when we do have free time, most of us are too tired to even spend it with others. Deep down we may actually want to be with others, but we are almost forced to be alone because we need to emotionally recover from the day. I know as a teacher it is hard for me to want to hang out with anybody after work simply because I am emotionally exhausted.

But, burnout at work is not just about this emotional exhaustion, it is also about loneliness:

https://hbr.org/2017/06/burnout-at-work-isnt-just-about-exhaustion-its-also-about-loneliness

Well, it is probably a mixture of both. Emotional exhaustion contributes to isolation, which probably causes loneliness.

From the article, “Loneliness, whether it results from social isolation or exhaustion, has serious consequences for individuals. John Cacioppo, a leading expert on loneliness and coauthor of Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection, emphasizes its tremendous impact on psychological and physical health and longevity….In the meantime, experts and companies have struggled to figure out how to counter growing levels of burnout. Many recommendations focus on relieving stress, teaching mindfulness, or reducing workload — all of which treat burnout as an individual condition. But its link to loneliness suggests that greater human connection at work may also be key to solving the burnout problem.”

Most of us spend the majority of our day at our jobs, and when we do communicate, it is either forced or fake with people we probably do not like much anyway. At the same time, we may come home and sincerely want to hang out with others, but we are just too emotionally drained. This is just another contribution to loneliness. Our free time is spent on recovery from work – not on the social interaction we need.

**But I hate people!**

You might be reading this and be thinking, “Well, I hate people anyway, so who cares?” The question is, were you programmed to hate people?

Before modern technology, our society was different. If you grew up with a smart phone out of your mom’s womb, this may be hard to imagine, but community used to be a valued part of society. Quite frankly, technology is destroying the quality of human interaction:

https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction

But, even beyond that, even the most introverted need a sense of community:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-introverts-corner/201502/why-even-introverts-need-community

And really, social communication is, in some ways, as important as food and shelter:

http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/we-are-hard-wired-to-be-social-248746

The thing is, we may feel this sense of social communication with technology, but it cannot duplicate real, human interaction:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2015/11/21/face-to-face-interactions-can-never-be-replaced-by-technology/#6f71520872ec

Besides, are you sure your hatred for others is not simply a purposeful divide and conquer technique?

“We fear connecting because it requires us to reveal something about ourselves. We are taught to hate the enemy — meaning anyone different than us — which leaves little room for vulnerability and an exploration of hate through empathic discourse and understanding. In our current society, one is more ready to fight than to resolve conflict. Peace is seldom the option.”

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201703/the-psychology-hate

Today, we are being trained to hate connecting with others who do not fall into our thoughts and paradigms.

**Anomie**

So, in our society, there is this purposeful breakdown that increases loneliness. Not only are people lonelier than ever, but there is a stark rise in suicides, especially among the youth:

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suicide-youth-teens-whats-behind-rise/

But why? Besides all of the factors I have noted, there is still more to this – there is this breakdown of society, but it goes deeper.

There are many reasons why people kill themselves, as noted earlier, but one reason rarely talked about is anomie. According to Wikipedia, “Anomie (/ˈænəˌmi/) is a ""condition in which society provides little moral guidance to individuals"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie

I have written so much about the moral relativism or our modern society, so feel free to check out my post history, that way I do not repeat much here. The article notes, “For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations.”

We are living in a society where nearly anything goes. Fuck who you want, eat what you want, and do whatever you want, and do not worry about any sense of standards. Why? Standards are bad, according to modern society. 

But people need standard and direction. People need morals. 
People are on the pursuit of happiness, without realizing happiness may not even be the goal they are seeking. I call this “Oprah morality” where people do what makes them happy with no further, philosophical thought on the effects on society. You can read more about “do what thou wilt” and “Oprah Morality’ in my post history, but I need to move on:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7fbdem/the_conspiracy_of_evil_does_evil_really_exist/

The other factor is that many are simply disillusioned with a society they cannot fit in with, and I know I feel that way at times. We are all here, on a conspiracy forum because we feel there is something ‘wrong’ with the world, even if we disagree with the reasons as to why it feels wrong.

Many of us feel like outcasts because we cannot speak about what we really believe. We may not worship the culture of materialism, celebrities, social media, sports, and so on, and we may speak out against the major narratives. Quite simply, many of us feel like outcasts who still have to function in a society we ultimately disagree with – what is the alternative? Is there even an alternative? Today, it is so expensive and nearly impossible to buy your own land and live without society, yet some people are living off the grid:

https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/22/opinions/living-off-the-grid-usoa-kamau-bell/index.html

Still, the question is, why is society this way? Was there a time when “depression” was not normalized? Was there a time when people liked other people? Was there a time when people did not feel lonely, but they felt fulfilled by their communities? I think there was.

Today, we have things to fulfill us, whether those be drugs, alcohol, video games, sex, buying stuff, working constantly, beauty products, social media, pets, money, power, porn, etc., but we do not have each other.

I used to think Amish societies were ridiculous, but, now, I am not so sure because they seemingly are happier:

http://time.com/3687995/why-amish-kids-are-happier-than-yours/

The point is that many are feeling disillusioned in a society that feels disconnected with no set of standards. Anything goes, and nobody really cares.

**Why?**

So, what would be the point of all of this? Why would ‘they’ want us to feel lonely and empty? Well, quite simply, it makes us easier to control. We want to fit and belong, and that is just basic human evolution, sociology, and psychology. Most of us will do what it takes to fit in. From 1984, 

“It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.” 
As somebody who has been targeted pretty severely online, I understand this quote. Fitting in is about survival, but that does not make us feel any less lonely. 

We do not want to commit “facecrimes” and the elite know this. So, we show a certain face to the world. We live in duplicity, or two worlds. 

But even darker, loneliness makes us more likely to kill ourselves and less likely to reproduce. Loneliness make us depressed, and less likely to contribute to society or change.

And they convince us that we will be just fine being alone! 

**Inversion of Loneliness to Oneness**

Right now, they are somehow convincing us that all of our problems, specifically with loneliness, will be solved through technology. Through artificial intelligence and virtual reality, we can have anything we want. We can create our own realities. Our future is with augmented reality:

http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-41419109/what-future-for-augmented-reality

But the problem is, it is all fake. We can create family, friendship, community, communication, fun, entertainment, and whatever in this virtual reality, but it can never replace real-life interactions. 

With modern new age religion, we are told we can be “one” with all so that we are not alone, but to me that is deceiving. 

Yes, we need other people to function in society, but we are still individuals, and loneliness is defeated when we value people for who they really are – not who we want them to be. Loneliness today is a product of trying to fit into a society where many of us simply do not agree with its main tenets. To conquer loneliness, we seek people that like us for we really are, but can we do that today? I mean, most cannot even post a picture without a million filters, and most cannot really speak their mind for fear of backlash and the eternity of the internet. But there is this illusion that people like us just the way we are, and the more likes we get, the more we feel that claim is validated.

With all of these interconnections, we feel like ‘nothing.’ The more technology ‘connects’ us, the more disconnected we feel because our uniqueness loses meaning. It loses meaning because we cannot find real people that value us anymore for who we are, and quiet simply, t is not really real. In real life, many friends like me because of who I am in, but on social media, my friends like me because who I am perceived to be, which is not the real me.

Loneliness makes us believe we are insignificant, and if we truly feel that, then our lives lose meaning. We stop living.

**Let’s end with some quotes**

“Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.” 
― Aldous Huxley, Ends and Means

““We can’t jump off bridges anymore because our iPhones will get ruined. We can’t take skinny dips in the ocean because there’s no service on the beach and adventures aren’t real unless they’re on Instagram. Technology has doomed the spontaneity of adventure and we’re helping destroy it every time we Google, check-in, and hashtag.” 
― Jeremy Glass”

“Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone.” 
― Dan Brown, Angels &amp; Demons

The conspiracy is that if we feel we have no value, then we feel life has no value, and larger society loses it purpose and value. We live our lives waiting for the next 'high' and we have this belief that, eventually, all our problems will be solves with some type of technological 'oneness' or interface. That does not seem to be the case. 

""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.""
–Albert Einstein

452,The harsh truth about women’s liberation,"
     The truth about women’s liberation is a harsh one. Hard for most people to accept as well. But the truth is women’s liberation was manufactured behind the scenes by some of the most powerful men in the world to help cause a complete breakdown of society and give more power to the state. The central planners, notably the Rockefellers, with help from many media institutions and even the CIA hailed women’s liberation as something great. Something progressive. Something amazing. When in fact it is causing a complete ruination of the family which seeps into society and destroys everything 

The propaganda put out by the women’s liberation movement was to make it the ultimate goal for a woman to get into the workforce and make something of herself. They put it out there that married women were being oppressed by their spouses and that women were only judged by the amount of kids they had in this evil, oppressive world. All the sitcoms and tv shows made it seem like single mothers were extremely unhappy, as they had to deal with a stupid husband and rowdy kids who were up to no good. They made it hip for women to go out in the workforce and do what they want with their bodies, and stay away from men and stop having families. Giving women all these opportunities sounds great in theory but actually it has caused massive repercussions.

1. More power goes to the state. Women’s liberation came and the government was able to start collecting tax from the other half of the population. Also as single motherhood rates continue to rise, that creates more need for government benefits and single mothers also vote for the left in overwhelming numbers, which also advocates for more government and more power to the state. Also as more mothers are busy with work, kids are spending less time with the family and more time under government funded institutions. It’s fair to say these government funded daycares are highly Marxist and left leaning. Also child daycare leads to feelings of abandonment, emotional disorders, and the constant need for attention.

2. Depopulation. With women’s liberation, women have become more busy with work and less inclined to be with men and start a family. Birth rates in America along with other western nations are at an all time low and they are lower than replacement level. 

3. Higher illegitimacy rates and higher single motherhood rates. With women’s liberation came the idea that women should be able to do whatever they want with their body with no regard for the impact it has on the future and the idea that single mothers were strong and valuable proponents of society. Single motherhood has brought along a multitude of problems. Kids with single mothers are much more likely to get involved in crime, drugs, and degenerate behavior that leads to a more chaotic and unproductive society. Today in the US, 1 in 4 children under 18 are raised by a single mother. 27.5% of single mothers are jobless and they are 5 times more likely to be in poverty than a married couple. 

4. Unhappiness. Since the 70s women in the USA and Europe have reported feeling less satisfied with their lives. It turns out stay at home moms are much more fulfilled with their lives. And the greater the number of sexual partners a woman has, the less happy she tends to be because she does not value herself and her body.


Women’s liberation has been a complete disaster for America and Europe. While there may be some arguments for it, it’s hard to deny that it is one factor that is causing the complete breakdown of the west and it was most certainly an inorganic movement funded by some of the richest, most diabolical people on the planet.

Neither do I. I was much too young. So were you.

However, I'm plenty old enough to remember last weeks incident at a Florida school. I say incident because of a peculiar finding -- or should I say, non-finding.

Where's the blood in the pix &amp; vids of this shooting? I'm no expert, but I have basic competency in the use of google and duckduckgo. I include duckduckgo because I can turn off the filtering of adult content, so there's really NO EXCUSE for not including the blood.

And I'm left wondering, where's the blood?

No expert here, either, but I did once see a pool of blood -- during the still-high-crime days of the early 1990's on Saint Marks Place in NYC's East Village. Honestly, first it looked like someone spilled fruit punch. Then I kinda figured it out. Probly a drug deal gone bad.

Pools of blood are many things, but they are not subtle. They are extremely blatant, obvious, and creepy like I can't begin to describe. Yeah, there were splotches of red in the pix &amp; vids that I checked out .. there were things that maybe were supposed to look like blood. But that unmistakable sense of a pool of blood? I couldn't find any such thing, as I skimmed through multiple videos of the alleged (sorry, but I have to use that word, for reasons I really hope you understand) crime scene.

I'm left wondering, "" .. t da ff .. ?"" (if you can parse that, I'll send you a gold star to paste on your forehead). Or in vernacular parlance, ""Where's de Blood, Mon?""

13,The Bible Says There Are Jews Who Worship Satan,"I am not saying all Jews are evil.

Ill say it again.

I am NOT saying all Jews worship satan!

BUT.

The Bible makes it clear that there will be some who worship satan and hide behind the name of the Jewish religion.

The world as a whole seems to reject absolutely anyone that says something negative about anyone Jewish.

Even if that person committed horrid wicked deeds, somehow, just saying they are Jewish is a shield from most reproof.

""The Jewish people have gone through enough persecution"" says those who defend wicked Jews, ""You only think they did wrong because you are anti semitic!"" they say.

Well, I am here to tell you, that the Bible says there will be, and probably are right now, wicked lying Jews who worship satan.

And there are lots of amazing Jews!

I know plenty of wonderful Jews! 

I used to stand with a gun outside of a temple protecting Jews!

They are fine folk, but like any race, culture or religion, there are bad ones too.

And the Jewish race/religion, or whatever they are, are basically the only ones that are socially unacceptable to speak poorly about.

Simply pointing this fact out has become taboo.

We need to confront this problem head on.

We need to expose the lying Jews of satan and separate them from the good Jews of God.

We need to take in what is really going on in the world with Israel, global banking, and governments abroad.

Over and over I see posts about how Jews run everything - a notion widely dismissed as nonsense.

But maybe they are the lying Jews of satan?

Wouldn't that make sense? 

And the worst part is that the godly Jews defend the Jews of satan, because they have a blanketed mindset of total defensiveness for anything Jewish.

This needs to change!

For the good of the entire world, go befriend a Jewish person, and tell them the truth!

Tell them that there are evil men, hiding behind the good name of their religion, in order to avoid persecution and to further their of nefarious plans.

Here is the Bible quote:

#Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.

22,A thought on Hamilton68 and the 600 Russian bots,"From Hamilton68 on the criteria for identifying ""Russian Bots""

""The initial dashboard tracks 600 accounts that were 1) identified as participating in specific disinformation campaigns synchronized with Russia Today and Sputnik News, 2) meaningfully linked to users who self-identified as promoting pro-Russian viewpoints, and 3) bots that provide support to members of the first two categories.""

Basically, this seems to purport that accounts that linked or retweeted articles from Russia Today or Sputnik News are reasonably believed to be Russian Bots. Given that item 2 captures only those accounts that blatantly self identified as Russian sympathizers and item 3 captures any accounts captured by either 1 or 2, it is logical to assume that the main driver is item 1, since arguably a Russian bot wouldn't out themselves as a Russian bot, which is essentially what 2 claims and 3 is essentially a catch all of 1 and 2.

It is arguable that Russia Today and Sputnik News publish more content that is critical of the US Government than US media outlets.  If an individual is critical of the US Government it is likely they will be forced into relying on information gleaned from Russia Today or Sputnik News rather than an outlet like CNN or Fox News as those outlets are generally critical of US Government actions as pertains to specific political parties i.e. pumping/denigrating either the Democrat or Republican political parties.

Perhaps these information trends like #ReleaseTheMemo are popular as a large number of the populace is becoming more critical of the US Government.  After all, there is reason enough to be critical.

The most recent two candidates from the last election were 1) a candidate whose campaign essentially purchased a political party, which allowed that campaign to sabotage the campaign of a competitor (a very popular grass roots type competitor or, 2) a candidate that is claimed to have essentially been co-opted by a foreign government, which, if proven, is absolutely insane.

Those were our two options as voting citizens and they were propped up by US media outlets depending on the inherent bias of the media outlet in question.

The Department of Defense is undergoing its first audit in its 68 year history.  Its budget is well over half a trillion dollars per year and we are just now deciding it may be a good idea to look at how that budget is spent...

A political candidate was allowed to self-identify what information was relevant to an investigation of impropriety.  That's ridiculous.

The FBI conveniently ""lost"" a large number of communications between two government employees subject to an internal corruption investigation.

Elected officials routinely pass bills that they admit they have never even read.

Elected officials selectively leak classified information and US media outlets selectively cover leaks depending on the content of the leaks and what political party they help/hurt.

From a certain viewpoint, it seems that there is quite a bit of reason to be critical of the US Government and by being critical of the US Government, you run the risk of being identified as a Russian Bot.

If you honestly support the notion that google, facebook, twitter, etc. should take an active role in curating what information should be available to its users, then I urge you to consider the various end results of such a notion.  In my opinion, the resulting information we will be ""allowed"" to see will be conveniently non-critical of the US Government as a whole, but will still very likely continue to be critical of one party versus another, thus perpetuating the continual divide of the American populace.

I'll end with a relevant quote from John Adams, ""There is danger from all men.  The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.""

If you don't trust Trump, good. If you don't trust Adam Schiff, Mitch McConnell, HRC, etc., good.  You shouldn't trust any of these people, but that doesn't mean you automatically shouldn't support certain initiatives.  You should have access to all information, critical or supportive, and be able to use that information to make an informed decision.

23,Chabad-Lubavitch Mossad,"from:

"" Confirmed: Chabad-Lubavitch is a religious front of the Mossad

As I was poking about this morning doing research for another article, I came across a confirmation of Chabad’s connection to the Mossad right on a Chabad community website…

…from Collive.com. Here’s an excerpt…

&gt; The [Lubavitcher] Rebbe‘s unknown ties to the head of the Mossad and their assistance to Chabad’s educational and outreach activities in the Former Soviet Union were mapped out in the Hebrew book “The Rebbe and the Mossad,” published in 1998.
The inside story of the Rebbe’s involvement in Israel’s security, as told by its defense and government leaders, is told in JEM’s documentary film Faithful and Fortified – Volume 1. 

I’d encountered internet rumors of Chabad’s connection to the Mossad before, but to see it spelled out by the Chabadniks themselves pretty much closes the case for anyone who can put two and two together. If you are new to this site, you might consider reading Trump and Putin: Agents of Chabad-Lubavitch (+ Trump and Putin’s Lubavitch-assigned roles) to see why this is significant.""",conspiracy,1516810841,TheMatouwacTorch,8,5,True,2018-01-24

29,Professional Sports are Rigged: Probably the Most Down to Earth Conspiracy You'll Ever Read,"Is rather funny but my foray into r/conspiracy was due to the dramatic comeback of the Cleveland Cavilers beating the Golden State Warriors after being down 1-3 and wondering was there something afoot. My senses heightened even more after a certain baseball team also came from 1-3 game deficit and a certain time  of mine had 25 point lead in a certain important game, but I digress. 

Several posters on this sub have mentioned that professional sports is nothing more preplanned athletic performance utilized by TPTB to entertain and distract citizens from the problems of their home and their world (Circus and Peanuts). While I don’t doubt that collegiate and professional sports are influenced by unseen powerful forces, there is down to earth evidence to suggest that many of these games in some way or another are compromised if not rigged. 

To understand this, one must recognize these three critical factors:

1)	Gambling in sports is an ongoing phenomenon.

Not an earth shattering revelation for many sports fans. Just look at how much money is made in legal gambling (i.e. fantasy sports): well over a billion dollars. I guarantee that the amount of cash wagered illegally dwarves this. However, when people think of sports gambling they believe it is only perpetrated by the audience. The truth is that not only do the athletes regularly gamble (in their sports and other leagues), coaches, managers, referees, higher ups in the League(s),  and even team owners engage in this act.

Don’t believe me? From “The Fix is In” by Brian Touhy:

“A pertinent fact the NFL blatantly overlooks as part of its historical development is that several of its early team owners were well-known gamblers. The New York Giant’s original owner Tim Mara (whose family still owns the team) had a history as a bookmaker before and even during his ownership of the team. He wasn’t alone.

Another original owner whose family still has control of its franchise, Charles Bidwell bought the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) after relinquishing his share in George Halas’ Chicago Bears. Bidwell was not just a gambler and a racetrack owner; he was a known associate of Al Capone (they shared the same lawyer, Ed O’Hare) and a bootlegger.

Beloved Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, Sr. was another big time gambler who reportedly won over $250,000 over a two-day span at the racetrack. Rooney would also own pieces in several horse and dog racing tracks and reportedly hired head coach Joe Bach to work off a gambling debt he couldn’t immediately pay off.

George “Dick” Richards was known to be a heavy gambler outside of his car dealership when he purchased and NFL team, moving them to Detroit to become the Lions. In letters he had foolishly written, Richards detailed how he bet on his own team’s games, including upwards of $50,000 on a single content prior to selling the Lions in 1948.”


2)	The Mafia/Mob have their hands in sports gambling. 

Once again, not really surprising that the Mafia/Mob would have their hands deep into a elicit activity that generates billions of dollars yearly.  Whether it is directly or indirectly, they regularly interact with the employees of the sporting world and several of the higher-ups in the league may have some type of business arrangement with these mobsters. If you interested in this particularly topic, I suggest that you read up on former mobster Michael Franzese.  


3)	If your gamble consistently, it is easy to get in debt.

For these athletes, coaches, refs and owners who gamble, at some point in their life they will amass serious debt (for owners and players, millions of dollars in debt). If they can’t pony up the cash, there are other ways to make up for it: whether it is point shaving (asked to score a certain number of points), flat out throw the game, or (as an owner) purposely handicap their team.

You might be wondering how those associated with these players do not call them out or try to remove them from the teams. Most likely, the other members/employees of the team are as gambling (but not in debt) and/or engage in other elicit behaviors. Exposing their teammates puts them at risk at being exposed. We’ve seen this documented in the movie industry, politics, and corporate culture. Is it really unreasonable to expect the same in multi-billion dollar sporting ventures? Ventures that our too big to fail?

Does that mean that every professional player gambles or is doing something illegal? No.

I do believe that there are athletes who not only avoid gambling but live fairly clean lifestyles. The reason they don’t speak out is that they would put themselves in the crosshairs of powerful sport leagues that have enough resources and power to blacklist and destroy their reputation. The more damning concern however is they soon must deal with the mafia/mob: entities that have no quarrels of putting these players and their family on hit lists. Disclosing to the public the art of game fixing will inadvertently open average citizens to these criminal organizations and that’s something that cannot be allowed. No player will ever put the lives of themselves or their family on the line for this, and can you really blame them.

Serious questions for those reading: If you had verifiable paperwork that linked violent criminal parties to professional sports leagues that are complicit in illegal gambling, would you release it to the public aware of the consequences and the forces you will reckon with?


So in a nutshell, large scale illegal gambling/fixing is the driving force for the outcomes of many major sports. If you are interested in this topic, I suggest you first read The Fix is In and branch off from that.

I was already a targeted individual and didn't know it (from at least 13 maybe my whole life, after talking to some people I think some spiritual people or people with certain energies/DNA are targeted from birth) right after I was able to astral project they induced horrible experiences with technologies to get me to stop meditating and torture me with directed energy weapons every time I meditate since.

I want to emphasize how fucking wrong and weird it is that I'm banned from meditating and no one knows or gives a shit that specific targeted individuals are tortured/harassed globally. Lot of paranormal/entity/alien experiences are caused by technology. Instead of 20 witches in the past doing rituals and focusing to kill a target now they learned how to alter and focus energy of an intelligent brain by technology. I think our brains are tools to navigate a world created by our energy/thoughts/emotions and those worlds exist because we're intelligent, creative and able to conceive them so our will/minds manifest different dream/astral worlds because we live to experience and life always tries to make the most of itself.

**Probably the most important thing I noticed while meditating a lot is a lot more good synchronicities were happening in my life and people I thought about even my best friend, who I was most connected to on a mental level, was having more dreams which were similar to mine and she wasn't meditating. It's as if life is like a very realistic dream and by meditating we gain more control over it.** This is probably why they never let me meditate, also I can shape clouds and heal some pains by focusing my energy, I feel the healing power of meditation is very powerful. I was meditating with good intentions, imagine what all PTB's symbolism/rituals/magick crap/control of different organizations and religions are doing to humanity. Every thought, action spoken word should be seen as a ritual.

--------------

I wrote this today for someone about the amazing dream within a dream I had and thought you might find it interesting, sorry I keep repeating this experience but I had a recent epiphany about a deeper understanding of the dream that I think is kinda important.

I had a very vibrant/lucid dream within a dream of a black void everywhere then rising with mountains and a planet being created quickly under me, the air felt electric and fluid, kept going higher and saw thousands of clear beings each with red hearts and veins through their bodies floating around 2 red spheres creating an infinity sign from afar, I got very close to them everyone was happy and I felt lot of energy and joy in the air and saw huge screens on top of the mountains showing people's smiling faces. One being noticed me, came through an invisible barrier between us and morphed into a very beautiful human-like being. It stared at me a few seconds and looked very happy to see me. 

I had an epiphany about the dream recently, maybe it was a recovered memory of what we used to be like or Atlantis and I had not interpreted it by emotions before but I've been reading more about (or re-remembering) these things and I heard in a very high astral level emotions are very important. The night I had this epiphany I was feeling especially spiritual and this thought hit me all of a sudden and it felt like it was correct: the being stared at me and was extreamly happy to see me because not many are able to reach a deep meditative state to perceive them, it's rare for a human to get a glimpse of the other side because we're treated like slaves and it expressed the reality of a war on our kind and how important it is for us to keep striving for peace.

46,I can appreciate how the situation in Syria has confused many friends and I will attempt to clarify some of the more confusing points. Turkey seems to be the most complicated element in that conflict and I will start with that. | George Ades via FB,"Turkey, a NATO member and one of the original ""willing"" partners of the US in that coalition against the Syrian people, has been instrumental in the creation of ISIS, by providing safe passage through its territory for these terrorists, training camps, distribution of American supplied weapons, the 10,000 brand new Toyota trucks, the order for which can be traced back to Ankara, hospitalisation for the terrorists, R&amp;R resorts for the weary ""jihadist"" and the direct funding of ISIS through the purchase of stolen oil from them that all went through Turkey.

The turning point was when the Turks made the mistake of downing the Russian SU-24 over Syria, expecting a response from Russia and a direct NATO involvement against the Russians, hoping they (Turkey) would get a share of the spoils in Syria.

When their NATO allies did not show a willingness to back Turkey and get her out of the corner it painted itself in, Erdogan realised he was being thrown under the bus and started accusing his former partners in crime of the same things he too had been involved in.

Erdogan's ""spilling of the beans"" did not go down well with his NATO allies that hastily put together a plot to oust and replace him with a more amiable puppet. However, the wily Putin who did not immediately respond with the expected knee jerk reaction to the downing of his jet and murder of the Russian pilot, saw the opportunity to ""win"" the now disillusioned Erdogan over, by informing him of the plot against his government and possibly even his life.

Armed with the information from the Russian secret services, Erdogan was able to foil the coup attempt and feeling grateful toward Russia that not only did not punish him for doing them wrong, but saved him, he promptly apologised to the Russian people and offered compensation to the family of the murdered pilot.

Alienated by his ""friends and allies"", Erdogan found a welcoming embrace in the arms of Putin who showed him the respect befitting the ego of the ""Sultan"" and introduced him to his Iranian friends who also showed him the respect he craved.

Erdogan's sudden turn was driven by his instinct for self preservation, but he's crafty enough not to leave the fence where he's perched and continues to exploit his country's geopolitical position to his advantage by playing both ends against the middle.

Threats of closure of the NATO base of Incirlik have forced the Americans to seek new allies in the region, as Erdogan had proven unpredictable, unreliable and too contentious; unlike the rest of the US lackeys.

ISIS, created by the US &amp; Co. was being eradicated by the Russian-led coalition and no amount of deliberate mistakes made by the US to assist that terrorist organisation could save them. The FSA, that the Americans also helped in order to overthrow Assad and generally destabilise Syria, proved either ineffective or more loyal to Turkey, as a large number of them were Turkmen, than to the US.

The CIA had recognised the ambitions of the Kurdish minority in Syria for the formation of their own state and capitalised on that. Promising the hapless Kurds all sorts of concessions in a future Syria, they won them over and began to shape them into a veritable army with modern weapons and US training.

This move by the US may prove to be the last straw that will break the camel's back as far as the alliance between the US and Erdogan's Turkey goes. The Kurds are anathema for Turkey in general and Erdogan in particular who sees this latest move by the Yankees as another betrayal of their ""friendship"".

What we have now is Turkey gathering all the remnants of the FSA (about 20,000 of them) and about 1,000 former ISIS fighters that were not considered important enough to be airlifted to safety by the US military, and placing them on the front line in its ""glorious"" battle against the Kurds in Afrin, with Turkey leading from the rear and restricting its role to bombing from the air, shelling from across the border and issuing orders.

Afrin, a Kurdish enclave in the northwest part of Syria, is not one of the Kurdish held areas where the Americans had much involvement in and there are no American instructors there, so Turkey's gambit there is considered a safe bet with minimum risk.

Both Russia and Syria express their ""objections"" to the Turkish involvement on Syrian soil (for the record), but there's no serious effort to stop them from continuing to play the role of spanner in the works of NATO. The Americans too, continue to caution Turkey against stepping out of line, but Afrin is not enough of a threat for their newly formed alliance and revised plans for Syria. However, Erdogan has made noises about moving against other Kurdish held areas too that are of great American interest and that host American military presence, and although that sounds more like a bluff than a serious threat, the Americans are sitting up and taking notice.

Now, the SDF the US is backing, although made up of mostly Syrian Kurds, it also includes a mixture of other groups like former FSA combatants and those ISIS members rescued by the USAF.

Although nobody's really pleased about Turkey's involvement in Syria, the Russian coalition recognises the advantage of having two former NATO allies at odds and, for the time being at least, they are willing to allow the Turks to cause some damage.

At this point, it would take a crystal ball to predict how all this will play out, but I'm pretty sure military planners in both Moscow and Washington are busily working on contingency plans for this fluid situation.

Firstly, the movie entitled ""42"" was released into 2013 theaters, telling the story of the famed MLB player Jackie Robinson. Jackie was the FIRST african american to play major league baseball, and played by none other than our infamous Chadwick Boseman.

Then, in 2014 Chadwick Boseman a supporting role in the movie Draft Day, where he plays ""Vontae Mack"", the FIRST pick in the movie's fictionalized version of the 2014 NFL Draft.

Additionally, in the 2016 Captain America: Civil War introduced Chadwick Boseman as the FIRST mainstream Black comic book hero, Black Panther.

Finally, in 2017, a movie detailing Thurgood Marshal's days as a lawyer before he became the FIRST african american US supreme court justice and was played by Chadwick Boseman!

Can this possibly be a coincidence? Is this a secret society running hollywood with unknowable motives? How long until we see Chadwick Boseman playing as Barack Obama? My fellow redditors, we must find the truth!

I'm boring and they will have nothing to gain. Well, I've pondered this question and I came to an idea why It is data for the production of Artificial Intelligence. What better way for a program to replicate human consciousness than to feed it, not one, not two, but millions of data, both raw and intentional. In order to replicate voices via smartphone recording, in order to replicate decision making via google searches, etc. I believe we are in the arms race for Artificial Intelligence and we had made a huge sacrifice of our citizens in order to produce it. It is completely necessary for the unwilligness and ignorance of being surveillanced, as it would produce raw actions and thoughts. The internet is the manifestation of humanities inner thoughts and ideas, a global consciousness if you will, but the downside is that in order to manifest such information about humanity, there has to be intent and will to do so. You present yourself on social media and reddit, not because of unconscious motives, but because you intend to do so. You take action to communicate, so that's 1/2 data of humanity. The other half has to do with problem solving, such as Google searches and youtube, browser history on how you came to such conclusion. Now, all of this being said, I'm not suggesting that this is a good thing, our individuality has been sacrificed, our privacy has been raped, its near impossible to get away from any such devices that will record your data. Your friends have phones, your work, the streets haves cameras, your entertainment, the grocery stores where you get your food, you are always being watched. The only way to opt yourself out of the AI development program is to go off grid and live out of society, which sucks, but thats if your desire for freedom is greater than the desire for conveinency. I do not see me fellow humans as a source of information for development of AI, but if you are trying to make a program, or entity.....that replicates humanity, you will have to dismiss humanity.

Quick Brit-fact for our American friends : I am from the same city as Jimmy Saville. He used to play in all the local nightclubs and everybody knew who he was. He is famous for being the first DJ to ever mix two seperate records. Look it up (i saw it on wikipedia, it's probably bogus. Cool if tru tho). Anyway, he was a well known pervert and was always photographed with young girls, like young, young. He was allowed access to a hospital wing in the LGI (Leeds General Infirmary). He paid for the construction of the wing out of his own money, which gave him access to all the coma kids, who he fucked. Very very messed up. What's more messed up is that that ward has saved thousands and thousands of lives over the years. Wierd guy.

So yeah, he was thrown under the bus after he died so he couldn't testify against the higher ups.

There was also a story of two boys (who didn't know each other at the time) from an orphanage or a borstel and they were frequently used as play-things for the royals. These two guys eventually told their story to each other and were going to testify. I believe that one owned a magazine or was an editor and he made an article saying they were going to testify.

135,Why isn’t anyone talking about Jeff Sessions attack on marijuana?,"This country is hitting an all time high for opioid use, the US is 5% of the total world population yet we consume 85% of the opioids produced worldwide. I live in Philadelphia where there are no go zones scattered throughout the city where police officers won’t even go unless there are shots fired (they probably avoid those calls most of the time as well).

To me it seems pretty obvious that this is yet another attack on the poor by Sessions. 

For instance when a rich person is caught with a bag of marijuana that is clearly for personal use they call their lawyer and are usually let off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.

On the other hand when a poor person is caught with the same amount of marijuana they have the book thrown at them (in most states). After said poor person is booked they usually spend a little time in county before their court date and release.

167,Serious warning about zoonotic disease threat.,"I want to give anyone who will listen a very serious warning about the spread of zoonotic diseases that I think the WHO/CDC is downplaying or ignoring completely. I have been doing veterinary surgery in Panama and Ecuador and recently got back from a clinic in the Galapagos islands. My colleagues and I have been noticing some very worrying trends in nearly every central and south American veterinary clinic we have been working at. I'll try to quickly summarize our findings and then go into a little more detail.
There has been a massive increase in the percentage and type of zoonotic diseases being found in the animals.
Nearly 100% of the dogs we tested had antibodies for parvovirus and  parainfluenza virus. Over 2/3 had antibodies for adenovirus and about a 1/4 distemper. These were wild type antibodies in unvaccinated dogs and in many cases we were finding that the families that owned these dogs had contracted these viruses. Many people think that a lot of these viruses can only infect their pets but this is not true.
We also found over 25% of the dogs and cats infected with dirofilaria immitis, bartonella, and wolbachia pipiens. Bartonella was nearly 70% and almost every family member who lived with the infected animal had also contracted this. Over 2/3 of the cats had T. Gondi and toxoplasmosis was very prevalent in their human family members as well. A good % of the cats also had herpes virus.

One of the most disturbing trends was the % of animals we found testing positive for the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease. Even more disturbing is that we believe this is being spread by some other vector other than the kissing bug which is currently considered its only vector. Our current theories are that certain arthropods such as ticks, bed bugs, fleas, or certain hexapods are spreading this. This is particularly bad because it is being spread between humans as well and can be fatal if untreated. 

Currently the CDC says chagas disease can be trasmitted in these ways 
-contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug
-mother-to-baby (congenital),
-contaminated blood products (transfusions),
an organ transplanted from an infected donor,
-laboratory accident, or
contaminated food or drink (rare)

In our testing we have shown that T. Cruzi parasites can be transmitted between rodents through sex, unknown arthropods, and that food/drink contamination is certainly not rare. I can assure you that if it can be spread through sex between animals that it can be spread through human sex. If it can be spread from animal to animal through unknown arthropods, it can be spread to humans this way.

The crisis in Venezuela is going to make this much worse. Climate change is going to make this much worse. Globalization is making to this much worse when people all around the word are having south american crops in their stores I can assure you that these parasites/viruses/bacteria are going to become a big problem in Texas after the Harvey flood waters have spread everything around.


Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn't give two fucks about what country it is in and isn't magically prevented from crossing the border.
The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.",conspiracy,1516836938,Gdfi,202,562,True,2018-01-24

172,curious ‘bout necrotizing fasciitis,"there’s been two news articles in the past two days of two different people (a young boy and a middleish aged woman) in two different states towards the west coast of the USA. 

the boy had fallen off his bike and gotten it from the soil and the woman thought she had the flu and was diagnosed as such when she went to the hospital 

is there a correlation between the flu and the bacteria? did anyone happen to catch how the woman contracted it? 


how easily is necrotizing fasciitis contracted? 

it’s probably nothing and not even a conspiracy but it’s strange to me to see two cases so close together considering i’m terrified of NF and it’s my actual nightmare and you never hear about it on the news (i was under the impression cases were fairly rare in the USA) 

i just get worried about diseases/bacteria (especially weaponized ones) as a means of pruning the human population. 

not trying to be a nutterbutter, i just wanted discuss something besides trump/hillary/russia/NK/BOMBSHELL NEWS/fake news/or ANYTHING POLITICS.

Like the past 10 years of bullshit is suddenly out the window and everyone should look ahead and not worry or think its a little suspicious that they are allowed to join?   

I'm not worried about Kim specifically, I am worried about his handlers and what the TRUE plan of the Olympics is. Maybe place him as a patsy?? 

TIN FOIL HAT ON.... Here is what I would do to spark WW3 if I was Kim (or his handlers).....

You know there are diseases out there which are manufactured that we don't know about... Ones the government has manufactured or other (worse than AIDS, ETC). Government or elite only have the ""serum"" so it wouldn't affect them.

People from around the world would attend the Olympics. Why not send sick people from NK to attend with some disease that doesn't take affect for a couple of weeks... and once everyone is back to their home countries the disease will spread widely and there would be no turning back. 

It could be worse than a NUKE in my opinion because it could affect many different countries and spark the biggest war ever.

- [Lucifer](https://www.google.com/search?q=lucifer+tv+series&amp;oq=lucifer+tv+ser&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.5612j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-americamovil-us&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8) is the lead character in a new show on Fox where he works directly with the LAPD. ""Lucifer"" is of course just another name for [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer)

- [12 Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) focuses on the war effort after the [9/11 Attacks](http://www.ae911truth.org/)


Now here are some things being treated as *Jokes*

- Illuminati, it's being used heavily in the most recent [Taco Bell Ad Campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLa4miaiXIA)

- The Mandela Effect is the focus of tonight's [X-Files Episode](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS778US778&amp;q=mandela+effect+x+files&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ5s_z8fHYAhUJ7VMKHebJAqwQBQgkKAA&amp;biw=1216&amp;bih=766). If it's anything like the rest of the season thus far, it'll be bull shit.

- Pizzagate, was the title of [this week's episode of MTV's ""The Challenge""](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtvChallenge/comments/7smc3k/the_positivesilver_lining_to_pizzagate/)



I think there's definitely some brainwashing going on here. It seems like the stuff they *Romanticize* is the stuff they want you to keep close to your heart; so you build an emotional connection with these stories. As we all know, when emotions take over, it's often very difficult for logic to change someone's stance. As for the things that are put in a more *Joking* like light, I believe it's an attempt to start a mindset along the lines of, ""That was a joke on TV, it's not real!""


I'm anxious to see what the other takes on this are.

192,Why the Super Bowl 52 Asteroid is fake.,"This “asteroid” is a fake. There has been plenty of predictive programming about asteroid strikes in the past, and we know Werner Von Braun warned of fake asteroid threats.

The game Zelda: Majora’s Mask is about the Moon falling to Earth amd hitting it, similar to an Asteroid. Zelda: Majora’s Mask is Z:MM which is 26 + 13 + 13 = 52.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wGRK6uFx1k

The game Sonic Adventure 2 is about the “Space Colony ARK” falling to earth and hitting it, which is similar to an Asteroid. Space Colony ARK = S.C.A.R.K. = 19 + 3 + 1 + 18 + 11 = 52

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1vDD6WDgM (Turn to 14:28)

The Asteroid Apophis 99942 comes in 2029 in 2036. The Philadelphia Eagles won by 12 and 17 in 2005 when they went to the Super Bowl. And they won by 5 and 31 in this year’s super bowl run. 
12 + 17 = 29, 5 + 31 = 36

Apophis is (1 + 16 + 15 + 16 + 8 + 9 + 19) = 84

99942 = 9 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 2 = 33

84 and 33. What is the significance of that? Deion Branch was #84 and Dion Lewis is #33. Dion Lewis is going to win the SBMVP, so the asteroid is an example 

Note: Deion Branch was #83 when he won SBMVP, but he was #84 for a large portion of his career, and his twitter name is deionbranch84, but that’s just semantics. Although I’m sure some shill will jump on this little fact because they need to shame anything that threatens the validity of this asteroid.

https://twitter.com/deionbranch84

The Asteroid Apophis comes on April 13 in both 2029 and 2036. April 13 = 4/13. 4 x 13 = 52

There you have it, now you know this asteroid is bullshit. It’s not like the asteroid was gonna hit the earth, but now you know that if this asteroid is fake, then any asteroid could be fake.",conspiracy,1516842562,Potisreallycool,41,0,True,2018-01-24

208,"Picking your battles: why the 9/11 ""no-planers"" should avoid arguing that there were no planes","It is clear that 3 WTC buildings collapsed on 9/11.  According to the official recored, they were the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd steel-frame buildings to experience total collapse due to fire.  They also became the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd buildings of any kind to collapse symmetrically due to fire.  This scenario is all just to unlikely to take on good faith from anybody, let alone the American Government!  And even if you thought the American Government were generally trustworthy and transparent with the people, would you trust anybody who was investigating himself?

I believe that the facts above are both easy to demonstrate--using mainstream sources, no less--and sufficient to motivate a substantial block of the populace, especially those of us who were too young to make our own opinions about 9/11 when it happened, to put in at least the time to, say, sign an online petition calling for an independent, international investigation into 9/11.  I go to a ""prestigious university"" and not a single person that I have talked to about 9/11 (about 10) had ever even heard of WTC-7.  One particularly skeptical though rational friend of mine said that in the 10-minute crash course I gave him in 9/11 conspiracy theory, he updated his personal probability that it was an inside job from 0% to 25%!

So way bother arguing that there were no planes!?  The burden of proof is so much higher than what I wrote above, isn't it?

Sidebar: something crazy I noticed the other day (I'm new to the rabbit hole, sorry) was that the fact that jet fuel can't melt steel beams is apparently one of these ""memes"" now?  The result of this is that you literally cannot bring it up as an argument because that argument has been associated so strongly with 1) humor and 2) tin-hat conspiracy theory.

Peace everybody!

EDIT: My post is meant to be strategic advice, not a stance on planes.  I am about to watch a no-planes documentary now, but thought my perspective approaching it without knowing the mechanisms would provide insight into what a no-planes theory might sound like to somebody who doesn't yet know its details.",conspiracy,1516847995,DFW_1996,88,61,True,2018-01-24

213,Someone used an old e-mail of mine to register a suspicious Reddit account,"Curious to know what you guys think about this. I was going through an old hotmail account I no longer use when I came across an e-mail from Reddit asking me to verify my e-mail for a username I had never seen before in my life. I checked out the username and they are an extremely active user on the_D, and post pretty much exclusively there. I decided to type the username into google to see what came up. Usual stuff, their profile page and some posts they had made. And then their profile page came up again, except it was under the Russian version of reddit, http://ru.reddit.co/.
The user in question claims to be an old lady from Texas. Their username bears no similarity to my hotmail account in any way, so it's not some accidental misspelling.

Has anyone else had anything like this happen to them? Am I reading too much into this? Is the_D genuinely swarming with Russian trolls?

edit: It is no longer possible to hijack the account, there's no e-mail associated with it anymore according to Reddit. Believe me it was the first thing I tried!

edit2: I also found the username on a pastebin full of the_d users, like thousands. What might this be used for?

Russia doesn't have many statistics about their economy such as about ""the amount of oil tankers in service right now"" , available to the public. It's a big nation, there are probably thousands of hidden quarries, mines, oil drillings, farms, etc, without anyone's knowledge. Within these resource creating facilities the employees are probably told to not say anything about the locations, but if they do, they are going to get put in prison, or killed. With the immense amount of corruption, the person who controls the oversight of the facility can control the income. Many Russians say they don't hate Americans, and Americans say they don't hate Russians, only the governments hate each other, which is reckless, savage for the modern world, and unnecessary in our global economy. Russias GDP is $1.5 trillion and the United States is $20.4 trillion. Russians need to stand the fuck up and revolt to fix this, because the root of corruption is fear, fear of losing. The entire police state, the absurd press coverage policy, and the consequences of free speech are the problems to which corruption is born.

The Bum’s Countdown
 01/02/2013

There’s a strange phenomenon I’ve noticed on several television reports from the early 1960’s onwards. There may be more before, but since I got my first television in 1962, I can’t say for sure. I would like to post this here to ask if anybody else has noticed, or seen any others.

It started in the early 1960s. Specifically, the Kennedy assassination. I was watching a broadcast by ABC of his final precession, and whilst the reporter was talking to the camera, amongst the crowd, I noticed something quite odd. A very scruffily dressed man standing quite a distance behind the reporter was staring right into the camera. He wore the typical attire of a homeless person. Dirty brown trench coat, a dark green woollen hat, and noticeably long facial hair. This wasn’t what creeped me out however. There was a massive amount of people around, and I just assumed this homeless man was here to watch the parade. The fact he was staring dead on at the camera motionless was quite off-putting though.

A little while into the report, he finally moved. He raised his arm in front of himself, and put him hand up, giving the number “5” with his digits. A few seconds after he did this, there was a loud bang, and a massive commotion in the crowd. The man stayed absolutely still, with his hand still outstretched, but the reporter and camera man moved to get a better look at what had happened, and the man was no longer in shot.

Kennedy had been killed.

Some years went by, and along the way, I seemed to forget about the strange homeless man from the Kennedy report. That was, until 1980. I had returned from work, and was absolutely shattered. My wife was laying out our evening meal, and I was just catching up on current events on TV. I changed to a particularly interesting report about a heat wave that was currently affecting some of the states down South. This concerned me, as my wife has relatives there, and I feared for their wellbeing. The news reporter was billing this as “The worst American heat-wave in decades.” At that point, I noticed him again.

In the distance, over the reporter’s left shoulder, was the homeless man from the Kennedy report. I didn’t notice him at first, and it was his initial movement that drew my eyes to him. As the reporter spoke, the homeless man lifted his hand once again, and signalled the number “4” with his fingers. I was more alarmed at the fact that the man seemed ”exactly” the same as when I had spotted him in the Kennedy report almost 20 years before. He was dressed the same, still wearing his trench coat, despite the reporter claiming that the heat was unbearable. He himself had removed his suit jacket, and had rolled his shirt sleeves up.

That man has made a couple more appearances in news reports that I know of. One in 2001, during a report of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centres, where he held up 3 fingers, and more recently during reports of the devastation Hurricane Sandy caused in New York, where he held up 2 fingers. Each time, in all 4 of these news reports, he has been dressed exactly the same, and shows absolutely no emotion. The people around him seem to pay no mind to him, and each time he just stares directly into the camera lens, until the report ends, or the cameraman moves the camera away from him.

I have written this because of his appearance in the Sandy reports. It is now 2012, and I know for a fact that DVD recording and such has become a lot more common. I have never owned a recording device myself, and so I haven’t been able to capture the man in any reports. Other people may have though, so I urge you to flick back through any recordings of the news reports you may have, and try and screen grab an image of the man if possible, so that we may identify him, and find out exactly why he is showing up at these events.

Right now I am very scared though. And I think it’s plausible that you all should be too. It’s obvious at this point that this man does not age, and appears in news reports of disasters- both natural and man-made. Not to mention, with the exception of the Kennedy assassination, many people have been injured and killed in said disasters, and it’s getting worse. It’s also obvious that this man is counting down to something in each one of the reports he has appeared in. And worryingly, he’s down to number 1.

I believe we need to have a spiritual revolution before we can have a successful political one. We must work on ourselves and find ways to thrive outside of the system that wishes to control our minds, bodies, and even our souls. Change comes from within and perhaps the system is just a reflection of our collective mind. Therefore we must change ourselves before we can expect to see any differences in the world we live in.

b : a group of conspirators ·a conspiracy made up of disgruntled aristocrats

•Conspiracy - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful

On the right side, the stated definition of 'conspiracy' according to this subreddit. It's inaccurate.

Although many conspiracies may involved some form of a negative motivation that doesn't pertain to the definition of the word. That's the paradigm and it would be prudent to adjust it appropriately.

Proof 'conspiracy' isn't purely negative. Ever arrange a surprise party for somebody? You and your friends -conspired- to make it happen.

Maybe this is the right place to post this. Maybe it isn't. I feel it's important to clearly define what these words really mean and separate world views from what is clear cut and defined. It also makes this entire subreddit look bad too, because that isn't the definition of conspiracy as listed on the right.

354,"It's funny that suspicion of Russian deep state activities is portrayed as another ""Red Scare"" while the ideological underpinnings of the original are being used to perpetuate a different form of ""Red Scare.""","As long as you are defining ""Red"" as inherently Russian in nature and ignoring the Bircher-era existential fear of communism (and in a general sense, economic equality and fairness regardless of wealth, class, race, or profession), I guess Red Scare can apply.

I'll be the first to admit that fear of all Russians/blaming everything on Russia is absurd, sets a dubious precedent, and will likely be utilized to crackdown on civil liberties, regardless of the merit of such accusations (which I'll posit are not always totally false and hyperbole-dripping. Competing deep states are gonna compete).

But but but...

One can acknowledge the slippery slope into classic Red Scare fear of Russia while viewing whole swaths of counter-accusations as also having a Red Scare-type underpinning, specifically the ways in which all progressive movements, thoughts, and players are being promoted as conducting conspiracies of their own-- usually in order to destroy the ""American"" way of life, crater capitalism and freedom, attack Christianity, promote ""devious"" lifestyles, etc. 

When you see posts railing against Cultural Marxism (Cultural Bolshevism in the original Nazi, we should be clear), the ""Homosexual/Trans"" agendas, portraying any progressive/Democrat cause as an evil plot to destroy the country...that's all Red Scare rhetoric, principally used by those who claim they themselves are the indirect victims of a present Red Scare (like the president). With all this, such players continue to portray all progressive ideas as conspiracies against the American people. 

Roy Moore was the most recent politician to do this, labeling all accusations against him as the work of scheming gays, trans, and socialists. Right out of the Red Scare playbook, spoken to cheering thousands at fevered rallies. 

The Democrats haven't done enough to prove the bulk of their Russian accusations have enough merit to stand beyond their words-- likewise, conservatives and the fringe right continue to propagate Red Scare-type narratives of their own.

387,Was reading up on JIDF and noticed something interesting...,"For those of you who don't know what JIDF is, it's basically Israel-funded shills who spread pro-Israel propaganda online. From Wikipedia:

""The Jewish Internet Defense Force (JIDF) is an organization that uses social media to mobilize support for campaigns against websites and Facebook groups that promote or praise what it describes as Islamic terrorism or antisemitism. The group's website describes the JIDF as a ""private, independent, non-violent protest organization representing a collective of activists"". The JIDF's work has been termed ""hacktivism"" by some media outlets.""

Noticed something interesting on Wikipedia. Caught my eye because I've never seen it before.

*Soon after, /r/topmindsofreddit stickied a direct link to it. Now the comment section shows obvious signs of vote manipulation.*

*TMOR has increased their attacks against me as of late, and this includes regularly stickying links to my submissions and manipulating the comment sections.*

When I questioned the behavior of Israel I was labeled an ""antisemite"".

When I questioned the policies and military interventionism of George W. Bush I was labeled as ""unpatriotic"" and a ""crazy leftist"".

When I questioned the foreign policy/drone assassinations of Obama I was labeled an ""extreme right-winger"".

And today, when I question the Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative I'm labeled a pro-POTUS Russian ""agent.""

I find it interesting that expressing doubt or concern over the ""official"" narrative and policies of TPTB/MSM gets one automatically pigeonholed and ""classified"" by those who parrot and embrace the status quo.

They are attempting to use these issues to turn us against each other, when we should really be setting our sights towards the top of the pyramid.

They'll continue to pull these labels out of their asses because honestly, at this point, it's all they have left.

Just remember that if you get attacked by these partisan hacks, then you know you're doing something right.

This seems to happen every time I fall Into a deep sleep via sleeping pills or meditating. 

In a state of deep sleep you reach theta wave brain frequencies which allow higher states of consciousness. 

Now every time I reach this level It seems there is a blockage. I want to know if anybody has any similar recurring dreams. I believe it's possible that certain nightmares are broadcast via radioqave frequencies to the collective consciousness that block out higher states of consciousness.

They claim that User DONKEY_SCHL0NG was Banned from this sub for posting this comment.

&gt; You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude it's been like a week since you said you were going to grow up as a mod and stop all these political posts. But you just can't stop. You're the one turning people against each other. You're talking about ""us"" as if we all agree with you. And you're posting yet another ""nothing to see here"" post about Trump and Russia. Jesus Christ dude. If you want to be an active Trump cheerleader on here then you really shouldn't be a mod. Edit: and I'm sure I'm about to be banned because we can't diss the holy mods. So catch you guys later.

I saw this comment be created and as I was replying to it reddit gave me an error and I refreshed and it was gone. Since the comment was there for less than a minute obviously I thought it was deleted and didn't think anything of it.

Then seconds after the comment is deleted user TheTwilightStone comments that a user's comment was wiped for criticizing the mods and completely lying saying it was ""the top comment"" which is impossible as it was only up for less than a minute unless they had multiple users upvoting it... It's almost as if he was waiting for the comment to be deleted so he could come in with the fake outrage to create the obvious brigade posted above... 

I responded saying that

&gt; Or maybe the user deleted it I never saw it to begin with...

And obviously this completely rational comment was immediately downvoted to shit.

&gt; Or maybe the user deleted it I never saw it to begin with...

Knowing he was obviously not from this sub I play dumb and say I didn't see it giving someone else to give the opportunity to confirm that they saw it and to see what he will say to that.

He responds with the following

&gt; Clearly you haven't because this comment had 7 points before you got here.

&gt; You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude it's been like a week since you said you were going to grow up as a mod and stop all these political posts. But you just can't stop. You're the one turning people against each other. You're talking about ""us"" as if we all agree with you. And you're posting yet another ""nothing to see here"" post about Trump and Russia.

So catch you guys later.

&gt; Dude named Donkey Shlong. Now his comment is completely wiped.

Which is *extremely* fishy for so many reasons. Let's start of withe the comment itself. Who the hell comments in a forum, "" I'm sure I'm about to be banned because we can't diss the holy mods. So catch you guys later."" Are you kidding me with that nonsense? The fact that it was deleted *as I was responding to it a minute after it was posted* just proves that he is trying to bait people into believing bullshit about the mods and this sub based off of a lie.

Now lets get into the response response. The user claims that the comment had exactly ""7"" upvotes. However at the time *ALL OF THE UPVOTES WE'RE HIDDEN FOR ALL COMMENTS* and to top it off he has *an exact copy of the comment* meaning that this user either was an alt of DONKEY_SCHL0NG or there was an active brigade to create this lie and TheTwilightStone was in contact with DONKEY_SCHL0NG...

TheTwilightStone then attempts to deflect and then his official response to him knowing the upvote count was that, he ""mistaked it for another thread""... Yea okay because a comment directed axolotl_peyotl would be posted on any other thread... He then says that after he saw the comment *which as I stated before was only up for a single minute* he copied it for later yea okay... 

As you can see TMOR obviously lied to try and create a brigade and are actively trying to discredit the mods and the users. Notice how NONE of the users even attempt to have discussion about the actual topic and any post even trying to talk about the topic is down-voted. 

How can we accept that there is a sub willing to slander and make up shit to try and discredit and brigade us? How is this allowed? This is unacceptable and I vote that all threads to go contest mode until this b.s. stops.

Where is the conspiracy? There is a group of people conspiring trying to silence those questioning official narratives by coming in and lying.

16,Orwellian World is Coming!,"# Eurasia

* Brexit is happening, the UK is exiting the Eurosphere and joining back the Anglosphere closely tied to the US establishment. This further provokes political and economical conflicts between the Anglosphere and the EU.
* The EU just created the PESCO agreement, one step closer to the EU army project, which they are obviously aiming at.
* The conflict between NATO and Russia is escalating in the past 3 years, but with the Brexit, looks like the EU is besieged on 2 fronts.
* The relationship between the EU and Russia might normalize and if the EU wants it’s own superstate independent of NATO, it has to let Russia into the EU.
* Stalin had proposed an Eurasian union back in the 50’s which the US rejected, so an Eurasian military union is not unlikely:
    * http://www.businessinsider.com/why-russia-backs-the-eurasian-union-2014-8?IR=T

* Thus the antagonism between the US &amp; Britain vs the EU vs Russia, the EU could let Russia in, thus forming the Eurasian superstate.
* The ideology of Eurasia will be Neo-Bolshevism, as the EU is already super-centralized, literally governed by commissars, and the Liberal Elite in the EU is basically Bolshevist. As you can see the EU is very against private property and would love State Capitalism to be implemented like in the Soviet Union, with some oligarchic exceptions. Thus Eurasia will be Neo-Bolshevist, governed from the center by 1 progressive Bolshevik party ruled by the Eurasian Elite.

# Eastasia

* The relationship between China and Russia is good now but only as a common interest against the US, if Eurasia is formed, they will become hostile, as China is building it’s own empire in SE Asia and extending it’s economic influence as far as Australia.

* China will gobble up all SE Asian countries into the Eastasia union eventually. The ideology of Eastasia will be the “obliteration of the self”. As we can see China is already ultra-collectivist, people have no concept of individualism there, things like the Sesame Credit is the perfect example:
    * http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-has-made-obedience-to-the-state-a-game-a6783841.html


# Oceania

* Thus the UK joins the Anglosphere, and the have no chance but to ally themselves against the massive influence of Eurasia.
* The US economy is on the verge of collapse, and the next financial crisis could wipe out the livelyhood of many people.
* We can already see as with the Bernie Sanders campaign and Jeremy Corbyn in the UK that the Anglosphere is increasingly moving towards socialism.
* If the collapse comes, the Anglosphere will demand Socialism, English Socialism, their own flavor.
* Ingsoc is born, gobbling up the Political Correct movement, SJW, and forming it’s own mixture from all the progressive ideologies. But it will be totalitarian.
* The new anglo alliance will be named Oceania, since it will gobble up North,South, Central America together with the UK.
* The Political Corectness will lay the basis for Newspeak, as they are already starting to censor words:
    * http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/02/23/the-common-language-of-the-common-core/
* With a Common Core education system and reshaping the meaning of the words, Newspeak is born.

By the year 2030 it will be mandatory for everyone to have a Smart TV in his house so that the Party can surveill everyone, and it will be always turned on so that people can watch the propaganda. Big Brother will be the name of the AI that will keep everyone under surveillance, using facial recognition, and since every major city is filled with CCTV’s and every home with Smart Appliances it will have total control over the lives of everyone in Oceania.

Mandatory vaccines, chemtrails, staged false flag attacks will be the norm in Oceania to keep the population frightened.

Meanwhile people will be forced to use the state controlled social media apparatus to participate in the 2 minutes of hate that will be done over social media, against the enemies of Ingsoc.

Newborn babies will have chips implanted in their brains so that Big Brother can read people’s thoughts, and zap them with electric shock if they commit a thought crime.

It will be a totalitarian world where the 3 superstates will have a phony conflict with eachother, meanwhile the majority of the population will be totally enslaved: mentally, physically, spiritually.

25,Merry Christmas r/conspiracy,"In the midst of spending time with our friends and family, I hope we can take a moment to celebrate the birth and most importantly the teachings of this great man, Jesus Christ.

His mission was to spread the Gospel, otherwise known as the good news. And his message was simple yet incredibly empowering.

He said, ""the Truth will set us free."" That, ""the kingdom of God is within.""

We suffer because deep down on an unconscious level, we are aware of our divine nature. However, society indoctrinates us into believing that we are inadequate and therefore must prove our worth, often through an engineered version of success. It is a losing endeavor where we are set up to fail as the game has always been rigged. And even for those who ""make it,"" there will always be an emptiness, a void that they cannot fill. Simply because there was never any void that needed to be filled in the first place.

This message was delivered over two thousand years ago but it is still relevant as ever. We are all sons and daughters of God! There is a divine spark within each and every one of us and there is nothing we need to do to earn or deserve it! All we need to do is to realize it. To come to know it. 

On this day, I hope we can all feel like kings and queens and treat others as graciously as kings and queens would. 

May the Truth set all of humanity free. And may the spirit of Jesus Christ live forever!

44,[Theory] Ajit Pai's fight to repeal Net Neutrality has little to do with Net Neutrality.,"I keep seeing Pai's image everywhere and it just so happens that most of the new images we see of Pai are ""meme worthy."" It's gotten to the point where it seems less coincidental and more deliberate. With so many groups/politicians fighting the FCC repeal of Net Neutrality, it's safe to say it'll most likely never actually happen. 

However, Pai's face is now the new image to hate. In today's day and age with polarizing opinions and social media, when one group hates you - the opposing group will blindly support you. This has been part of Pai's plan the entire time. Whether the repeal actually goes through or not is not of his concern. He knew he'd be hit with heavy-handed backlash, he knew people would hate that stupid ""popcorn meme"" or that new image of him in a Christmas hat on and it's exactly why he did it. Now he'll forever be tied to the idea that he pissed off ""Communist snowflakes"" and ""Liberal cucks."" He's the new age Conservative, Trump supporters will rally around his ""Capitalist values.""

So trust the paralegal, investigative, and journalist groups that are working tirelessly to make sure FCC's decision doesn't hit the voting floors of Capital Hill.

91,Something weird I found out from Obama's latest Christmas Tweet.,"So, if I remember correctly...some months ago someone made a thread and found out that an Image from his Twitter profile was used during some kind of a celebration, and the image itself was kind of ""reposted""... I mean he Twitted a picture of his family outside the W.H or something that he posted a year before that. 
This might be coincidental but he did it again...the images he's taken photos with his family, are older than they seem to be. 

Look at his [latest tweet](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/945324527520804866) 

Now head over to google images and reverse search the image, you'll find out articles and websites containing the very exact image dating back to 2016 and even 2015. 

Here's an example from an [article](http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/12/25/obama-family-christmas-card-2015-family-photo/) dating back to 2015 which shows the exact same image that Obama tweeted. 

As I said, this isn't the first time he's using an old picture of him and his family and tweeting it as ""new"". 

With all that's going on in U.S right now...I mean...so much conspiracy on the [Hezbollah](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/) scandal that involves Obama letting them get away... and Donald Trump declaring a state of emergency involving human abuse and corruption...is it safe to think someone else is handling his twitter, and Obama himself in some kind of custody? or is being investigated/interrogated? or even on the run?

I don't know why would ANYONE use an old picture , especially Obama himself posting that on his twitter.

I also watched that documentary Is O.J. Innocent? The Missing Evidence which did a good job of debunking the Jason being the killer theory. However, it still provided some evidence that suggests another person was with OJ the night of the murders.

162,I was brainwashed for two years and I'm just starting to learn the world.,"Hi Reddit,
I browse this subreddit occasionally.

I understand some people know a lot about brainwashing (I don't, experience aside), and I would like to hear your takes. I don't understand where we are at in politics. I think it is interesting what's written here.

I went through brainwashing and conditioning as a slave for a very twisted man. He tested things on me because I let him at first... and then things got out of hand. I lost myself completely. There were things I could not say. There are still things I cannot say.

Examples: I would be tied up for days in a closet for a minor transgression and forced to drink water only when allowed and from a bowl with a leash and collar attached in order to choke me. I had phrases I had to recite daily or receive punishment. I was sexually attacked repeatedly for years and forced to recite sayings or listen to things as it was happening. I was made to believe I was not human and I believed it entirely and still sometimes believe it to this day. These are just some things I have lately been able to say. 

This all occurred inside a rental house in a rural area. I am 22 years old now. I had been a recent college student when this began. I do not know what I did to make this happen. I was abused as a child, but I don't talk about it much. I was, by all accounts, a normal kid. Besides having occasional flashbacks. The man who did this to me -- I do not know him anymore nor do I think I ever did. He skipped town soon after. 

The Point: 

If anybody has questions, I will answer them. 

I don't know what gets traction here, what people are interested in, but if this is anything you are curious about -- I'm no genius on the science, I'm just healing now -- but I'll try to answer completely, from a survivor standpoint.

177,Lets try out your critical thinking skills. Trump Jerusalem fiasco.,"If you are genuinely here as a concerned citizen, I ask that you put aside your political beliefs just for this one time. Just be completely honest with yourself and answer this question: 

Would any President Of The United States know 100% that there is no chance that the other members of the UN would vote to move the capital of Israel to Jerusalem? 

Now Trump could be the dumbest person to ever walk the earth, but 100% his advisers would know from history that no way in hell would the UN vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And Trump isn't that dumb either. 

He knew damn well that the UN members WOULD NOT pass the vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 

So why did he do it? Why would he make a huge move like that knowing exactly the outcome? 

Could have been any, none or all of these: 

1. He wanted to see who voted which way. 
2. He wanted to bring an uprising against Israel, and he looks like the good guy. 
3. So he can say he is on Israels side the next time they start to call him anti-semitic again. 
4. To have a good reason to strip away money from a UN he already doesn't want to give money to. 

There could absolutely be other reasons, but one things for certain, he knew the UN members would say no. 4 seems the most likely to me, tbh. ",conspiracy,1514264218,WayneCarversMedSkool,43,5,True,2017-12-25

Shape Encyclopedia

Algorithmic

Shape is a complex conception – for ex, a circle is complex, but simplified after post-cognitive processes.

If we separate ourselves from all other shapes, shape is complex. If we presume junction between self and shape, numerous shapes are simple.

Shape Algorithm is a partition for the knowledge of the first fundamental shape complexity; a foundation for further genesis.

Shape Algorithm is best described as the super-symmetry of a dot and a line; a dot and a line support numerous possibilities – a duet that stops at a limit prior to Algorithmic II, in an Algorithmic Set. Algorithmic 0 is a document that can only be understood with mastery in Algorithmic Set.

Atomic and Primal Atomic universe super-symmetry is a perfect example of Shape Algorithm. A Primal Atomic Universe is considered degrade when compared to an Atomic Universe, but is upgraded to keep a fair continuum. Super-symmetry of Shape Algorithmic, is the continuum of Atomic and Primal Atomic –more pain for more pleasure and less pain for less pleasure, symmetrical universes; it can be derived to simple Atomic processes, such as spin and charge, which have a more direct relation to shape. 

Shape Algorithm is comprehended by Man when Man understands the rhythmic nature of Atomic, and Primal Atomic super-symmetry. A pointless atom is drawn mentally symbolic of Shape Algorithm; comprehension of “why?” is the rhythmic understood.

A way to understand Shape Algorithm is through study and acknowledgement of genesis types, so that a correlate theme is known; Algorithmic II genesis types are distinguished by rhythmic differences to Algorithmic genesis types. Ex Shape Algorithmic Universes: Atom Tilt Universe, Atmospheric Atom Universe, Winged Atomic Universe.

Algorithmic II

Shape complexities of Algorithmic II level are orientated to a symmetrical sense of super-symmetry, over super-symmetry itself. If we can conceive Shape Algorithmic, symmetry of Shape Algorithmic is conceivable. Shape Algorithmic II is where atoms are viewed from angular aspect and as abstraction; spin and charge processes are met with hyper whelm and cold charge processes.
Overwhelm mechanic genesis theory is the justified doubling of Shape Algorithmic; Cold Charge is division of Shape Algorithmic – there are other processes. Processes at Algorithmic II level are different because pre-Algorithmic II processes are personal adaptations. For Ex, spin, and charge are arrhythmical to hyper whelm and cold charge processes.

Algorithmic II is understood as the dissolution and coagulation of shape. Feedback and efflux principles are to be noted when considering genesis types. Algorithmic II shapes can upgrade or be upgraded by Algorithmic level shapes, or make unique shapes. Ex Algorithmic II Universes: Swivelled Atom Universe, Neuro–Atomic Universe, Cold Charge Winged Atomic Universe,

Animation of an atom can be imagined, similar to the atom that can be drawn pointlessly. If Man can imagine animation of an Atom, that Man has comprehended a symmetrical rhythm.

Algorithmic II and Algorithmic III differ in shape; Algorithmic III is a foundation for shapes found in Algorithmic II with shapes of Algorithmic; theoretically a doubling if united with Algorithmic and Algorithmic II chronologically.

Algorithmic III

Shape complexities of Algorithmic III level are background to Algorithmic shape complexities, and are orientated around Algorithmic II shape complexities. 

Geometry of an Algorithmic III level is imaginable –there is silent passage between Algorithmic II and Algorithmic III. After a switch the shape of Algorithmic II is alien to the shape of Algorithmic III; hyper whelming and cold charging processes of Algorithmic II are countered by new duplicating and manifold processes, plus other processes. 

Random Nature can be experienced on an legendary scale with others of the same kind; and these experiences can be perfected. The projection of all shapes in Algorithmic III are a central oppose in perspective with Algorithmic and Algorithmic II, a universal fabric seen at multiple abstract angles. Algorithmic III is a compendium of more advanced shapes than minimized experience – an transitory cut.

Ex Algorithmic III Universes: Primal Paste Universe, Color Ornamented Universe, Rhythmic Candlelight Universe.

An augmented atom and augmentation gear can be imagined, in doing so, a new metaphor is known.

Algorithmic IV

Algorithmic IV, unlike Algorithmic III, is a foreground and a micro-background shape compendium, with all prior Algorithmic –unlike Algorithmic III shapes are not not automatically accessed requiring a rhythm of an Algorithmic III shape, or prior knowledge.

Shapes of Algorithmic IV concern more the forces than a determined action; for example, matter of the energy of imaginary environments –a pixel of an experience. Another example, Futuristic Metaphorical Energy; evolution at the ends of energetic experiences.
Ex Algorithmic IV Universes: Candy Cane Universe, Hyper Light-Vessel Universe, Jester Paradox Universe.

Algorithmic 0

Algorithmic 0 is not a part of Algorithmic Set; it is a collection of shapes, neuter to shape perspective. For example, a cut-out human body to present a neutral genesis shape that's free of limit.

Ex Algorithmic 0 Universes: Strung Cherry-Tree Atomic Universe, Soul Valley Universe, Light Hyper-Animal Fodder Universe.

Sensory-i Mutation

A person can mutate sense with eye movement, by overlapping the sense of the unreal, attaching a correlate body to normal sensory.

Sensory is manipulated, and mind technique is developed for external visualization ability.

Visualization ability is upgradable, production of mutant-i can be elevated to production of imaginary scene capture, and further.

A, or multiple, visual fields of atom shape can be predetermined for mapping a visualization resource; a visual field, in this case, is imagined as a suited still person with duet, overlapping rings – this can be imagined overclocked.

With enough experience of mutant-i regeneration, an energy deposit can be experienced.",conspiracy,1514286962,trapeeze,6,0,True,2017-12-26

256,How a Public School Covers Up a Highly Contagious Disease,"Setting: 2000 student high school in a large metropolitan city. 

Student Population: 95% non-white. Primarily Black, Asian (mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), and Hispanic.

Situation: Student visits his family in India. Returns to school a few weeks later. He is weak, struggling to breathe, coughing up blood (according to eyewitness accounts), and clearly losing weight over the course of 3 months. His attendance drops from 95% to under 50%, but he is still attending school semi-regularly. Unbeknownst to the school (supposedly), he went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed. It is not known how long into this 3 month period he went to the hospital. 

It is finally revealed to staff and faculty only that this student has tuberculosis, a highly contagious bacterial disease that is transmitted through the air and affects the lungs. 

Only the student's teachers and a small, select group of students (those who sit next to him in class and his close friends) are tested for TB, after the student is seen coughing up blood in the hallway (a full 3 months after he returned from India, where it is believed he caught the disease). All other students - and their guardians - are left in the dark, despite the fact that TB is highly infectious.

Lingering questions: Should the school have notified every student (or at least a wider range of students), given the particularly contagious nature of this disease?

Should the school and/or teachers have noticed sooner considering the student's alarmingly low attendance rate and deteriorating physical appearance?

Did the hospital let the state Board of Education or the school know about the student's disease?

Was it a miscommunication, a complete lack of communication, or secrecy that could have endangered the health of students and staff?

How long was the situation known by the Board of Education and/or school administrators/school medical personnel?

This may not be a conspiracy, per se, but it was a blatant cover-up by a public school whose main responsibility is to educate and keep students safe.

For any parents reading this, never be afraid to ask questions and do not trust that schools have your child's best interest at heart. They only look out for themselves and how to best mitigate any damage.",conspiracy,1514302777,LearningIsListening,16,20,True,2017-12-26

284,Alleged evidence of old 'UFO sighting' photos that seem to take a similar appearance to the recent 'Spacex launch' observations. A rebuttal.,"This is a repost of my comments on a different thread that is generating buzz regarding these 'old' photos. Here are the links to the articles with the pics, pasted from one of other threads (thank you, original Op) that I wanted to focus on:

&gt;This was photographed at Christmas time 1937 in Vancouver and reported a UFO incident

&gt;http://vancouverisawesome.com/2012/02/08/vancouver-was-awesome-ufo-over-city-hall-1937/

&gt;40 years later in 1977 Petrozavodsk, Russia it was photographed and also reported as a UFO incident

&gt;https://www.fern-flower.org/en/articles/petrozavodsk-phenomenon


I'll be the buzz-kill devil's advocate here. Feel free to throw spears but please show your work (have more than a 5th-grade counter to my argument, please).

The Norwegian spiral launch was in 2009, but the first of only a few sighted phenomena that had since took this specific shape seemed to occur next in June of 2010 from a [Kyrgyzstan launch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yo8f7fQFO8)

With that said, please look for a preponderance of pre-2009 articles that relate to the UFO examples from the original Op's links from above (I've also posted a link to the original thread at the bottom).

I'll help. There wasn't much of any. For the Vancouver UFO, at least, all post 2009 links come back to one 2009 source, a British Columbia UFO website.

http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083118/http://www.ufobc.ca/History/Early/cityhall_v2.htm

At best, most other links are to crap SEO'd sites and had cut and pasted the same narrative, crediting the above source. Here's the heart-breaking piece: the only pre-2009 version of the cut-and-paste narrative that I could find was the following link from 2005. The problem is that the narrative goes with a totally different picture.

http://web.archive.org/web/20050403234534/http://www.burlingtonnews.net/ufofiles.html

So, with this last point especially, one could take any old narrative, and then rehash it with a newer 'old' photo. This narrative was convenient because it mentions a ""bright blue light (dropping) straight down from the sky"". Never mind that the Spacex launch sighting didn't do that.

With that said, for all of you Project Bluebeam lovers out there, I've got some more ammo for you. Here's a scenario:

* Step 1: Create the physical tech - rocket-launched aerial phenomena and concurrently plant an 'old' photograph that corroborates your phenomena. Hypothetically, according to what I've posited here, this could be done with low effort.

* Step 2: Create a disclosure buzz.

* Step 3: Profit.

Here's one last thought experiment: If 'they' could have been a little more careful about not having their R&amp;D launches observed, and if they could have successfully removed all of the evidence of the launch contrail, how much easier would it have been to sell this phenomena to you right out of the gate?

It, of course, then begs the question, why were they so sloppy with revealing their hands before they were ready to present the big shoe, if this were all the case. I couldn't presume to know, but it's hard to account for failures in R&amp;D planning, execution, and desperation stemming from a potentially accelerated timeline, caused by concurrent geo-political events.

Regardless, I ask you to apply some rigor to your enthusiasm about this, and to what I'm positing here. And...go.

346,"I don't know if anyone noticed this about the Solar Eclipse, it's insane.","The Solar Eclipse on August 21, 2017 went from Oregon (33rd State) to South Carolina (8th State). 33 days later was September 23, 2017, which was the Revelation 12 sign as predicted in the bible. 8 days later was the Las Vegas Shooting.

What is also interesting is this. Hugh Hefner died at age 91 on September 27, 2017. Dion Lewis (RB for the patriots, also gonna win SB MVP) turned 27. The shooter was age 64. 91-64=27 September 27th is the 270th day of the year. September 27th is also 4 days after September 23rd and 4 days before October 1st. Hugh Hefner was the playboy creator, and what animal goes with playboy? The Bunny! Or rabbit. In the Chinese zodiac, the playboy bunny is the 4th sign. 

So we have 33 and 8, or 33, 4, and 4.

The 911 attacks were September 11, 2001, or 9/11/01.
Las Vegas shooting on October 1st, 2017 was at Route 91 festival, on 10/1, 91 and 10/1 = 91101 = 9/11/01
So clearly there is a link between 911 and Las Vegas.

Also, on September 22, 2017, Puerto Rico suffered a Dam Break. In Evan Almighty, the dam break occurred on September 22nd!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpmRQI64Lzk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrVYSxcxVQ

Between September 22nd and 23rd, there is 1 day.
Between September 23rd and 27th there is 4 days
Between September 27th and October 1st, there is 4 days.

1, 4, and 4 = 144. Kinda like the 144,000 selected in the bible.

September 11 is the 254th day of the year.

Solar Eclipse 2017 = 33rd state to 8th state (33-8 = 25)
Now, if we look at the next Solar Eclipse: it is in 2045, and is from California (31st State) to Florida (27th state). (31 - 27 = 4)
25 and 4 = 254

The title of this book is ""End of days 2014 to 2018, new world order by 2045""

https://www.amazon.com/Days-2014-2018-World-Order-ebook/dp/B00I0MQ8KG

Now, what does this title mean? Well, 2045-2014 = 31, 2045 - 2018 = 27. The book is hinting at the Solar Eclipse in 2045!

Now, if you look at 44 years after 9/11, and go back 33 days, you arrive at August 9, 2045. That is the day of the fake alien invasion. The New World Order will go into effect on August 11, 2045. August 9th = 221st day, so 144 days left. August 11th = 233rd day, but if you start the calendar according to the astrological year, which starts March 21, you subtract 79 from 223. (223-79=144) So, August 9 and August 11 have 144 in them. Not only that, but August 9th, August 10th, and August 11th are the 221st, 222nd, and 223rd days of the year respectively. 221 + 222 + 223 = 666.

So there you have it, the solar eclipse this year was a sign of the times. Get ready for the alien invasion in 2045. It's gonna be a massive hoax!

Their unfolding plan is to create a New World Order under their control enslaving humankind. They are among us engaged in a social engineering program to create the foul and ungodly world they want.

Children are essential for keeping the Nephilim's elderly henchmen going, because youthful blood (esp. age 5 or younger including babies) when transfused to the elderly has a regenerating effect. The scientific study of this subject is called ""Parabiosis,"" but more rightfully it should be called vampirism. Children's blood is also sought for use in their satanic rituals.

It is illegal to take children's blood, so other means must be used to acquire it-- such as kidnapping children, and from illegal bloodbanks where a database has been setup for identification. Children are also being SOLD to wealthy people in order to use their blood to extend their lifespans.

The Nephilim hide in the dark allowing their henchmen to do their actual dirty work. These diabolical aliens are nocturnal, not able to tolerate direct sunlight; they are of only one gender- male, so they cannot repopulate as human beings do.

“...In the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death...” (Job 24:16)

The Nephilim must depend upon cloning and robotic technology to increase their numbers, and for the cloning they need good genetic material that they lack-- OUR GENETIC MATERIAL! 

These infernal aliens are using their technology to barter with people and governments that will trade our DNA for it. For decades they have been exchanging their technology for the DNA they need. We must be wiser and NOT trade our biology for their machinery. They need us, WE DO NOT NEED THEM!

The demonic agenda of these aliens squatting on our world needs to be exposed and all of them driven off the Earth!

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html) and the rest of the worldwide establishment media, is now openly acknowledging the existence of an intelligent ET presence on Earth, largely because of DeLonge and his intelligence community handlers in To The Stars Academy. 

Yet there is one overlooked aspect of this UFO disclosure, and it's this one: [DeLonge's team](https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/) includes several people with a background in genetics and biotech. Why is that? 

His team is fairly small, and a disproportionate number of the people are biotechnologists. Seems a bit strange, no? 

Couple this with the fact that DeLonge and his team refers to all UFOs as *threats* ... and we might just be headed for some interesting times, aka a staged alien invasion or at least some fictitious ""war against the aliens"" to bolster the MIC.

362,"Just got banned from r/ConspiracyMemes. Was my comment ""race baiting""?","I got banned for apparent ""race baiting"" in a comment that was quite the opposite even explaining the issue of getting labeled ""racist"" or ""Anti-Semitic"" as a way of censorship. Here is my comment:

""This is going to become a bigger problem as time goes on especially since the United States aiding Saudi Arabia under the ""friendship"" of Israel to militarily enter Iran and soon after probably Lebanon. This problem is the overall clumping of Jews as the culprit. It's not Jews it's the concept of Zionism and the elite that are the keys here.

Many citizens of Israel that are of the Jewish faith and Jewish race have a huge problem with Zionism and renounce it not wanting it to be associated with the Jewish citizens of Israel. They are also having a huge problem with their Prime Minister Netanyahu and his corruption within their political system. Does that sound familiar with any other countries where the citizens are not properly represented by their organizations and leaders?

Jews are not the problem it's the higher echelons of the elite that control their country and others. The elite have no allegiances to religion, race, country, or political beliefs. They are on a different program of overall getting Globalism as the control to ""unite"" the world.

Even now in the United States we are making odd forced allegiances to anything to do with Israel and where politicians have to sign documents stating they will not speak out against Israel's agendas and actions to get into higher levels of government. Also, after the recent Hurricane that hit Texas, citizens in the areas affected couldn't get their Harvey relief fund unless they signed off that they would not boycott anything to do with Israel and its affiliates. Why? How is that constitutional or even remotely okay to get American funds for American citizens?

This legitimate overall concern is going to get muddied in the waters of ""White Power"" groups and ""Anti-Semitic"" hate speech. This will be the new censorship and limited free speech in the next coming years.""",conspiracy,1514329533,conanclone,19,0,True,2017-12-26
363,"Donald Trump Assassination on July 21, 2023","First off, check out this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRxiYfLjogs
The Simpsons predicted Trump being president, and they have predicted him being assassinated. And the video is dated July 21!

Tecumseh’s curse: Every president elected in the year divisible by 20 dies in office. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush actually did not die, but there was an attempted assassination on them.

Donald Trump looked at the Solar Eclipse without glasses on August 21, 2017 at the age of 71. 71 months later is July 21, 2023. July 21 is 7/21. 7 years after 2017 is 2024, and 21 years after 2024 is 2045, and 2024 and 2045 are the dates of the next solar eclipses.

-Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865. (Aries) John Wilkes Booth was assassinated on April 26, 1865 (Taurus) 
-John Wilkes Booth was age 26 on April 26, 1965
-John F Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated on November 24, 1963 (Sagittarius)
 -Lee Harvey Oswald was age 24 on November 24, 1963
-Donald Trump will be assassinated on July 21, 2023. (Cancer) His assassin will be killed on July 25, 2023 (Leo) 
-Trump’s assassin will be age 25 on July 25, 2023

Lee Harvey Oswald was killed on 11/24. 11 days after Abraham Lincoln was killed, his assassin was, 2 days after JFK was killed, his assassin was, and 4 days after trump was killed, his assassin will be.

Takes note that in each situation, The assassin is killed in the next zodiac sign. Kennedy is 8-9, Trump is 4-5, so that points toward the 8/9/45 or August 9, 2045 Alien Invasion

John Wilkes Booth bwas born in 1838. Lee Harvey Oswald was born in 1939
38 + 39 = 77. 18 + 19 = 37. Trump will be 77 years old and 37 days old on July 21, 2023

Kennedy was assassinated in the year of the rabbit. Trump will also be assassinated in the year of the rabbit. There is a common joke in the “coincidences” between Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, which is that Abraham Lincoln was in Monroe, Maryland, and John F Kennedy was in Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn Monroe was in playboy, which is represented by a bunny, or rabbit! Also, Hugh Hefner died 4 days after  September 23rd, 2017, the revelation 12 sign, and 4 days before October 1st, the Las Vegas Shooting. The Rabbit is the 4th sign in the Chinese Zodiac. More importantly, Hugh Hefner died 37 days after the August 21, 2017 solar eclipse! And, Donald Trump was featured on the playboy cover in 1990, which is 33 years before 2023!

In Shadow the hedgehog, there is a level called “Air Fleet” In which you must kill the president.  It is the 14th level of the game, (Trump is born on June 14th) and it is either the 29th or 35th mission in the game, depending if you count the boss fights (Kennedy born May 29, 35th president.) The other mission, FYI, has you killing the aliens, and there are 35 of them. Anyway, in the very beginning, the character “Tails” is telling you all about the threat the president. Tails is very golden, like Donald Trump’s hair. Also “Tails” and “Trump” start with the letter “T”. Lastly, Tails is a Fox, and a common story is of the Fox and the Hare! A Hare is a rabbit!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ1zO3Tm6ME

Also, in Shadow the Hedgehog, there are a total of 326 story endings you can get, depending on the missions you go through. Kennedy was killed on November 22nd, the 326th day of the year!

In Pokémon, the 721st Pokémon is Volcanion, who is a water and fire type. Cancer is a water sign and Leo is a fire sign. Trump will be assassinated on July 21, 2023 (Cancer/Water Sign) and his assassin will be killed on July 25, 2023. (Leo/Fire Sign)

Kennedy is killed on 11/22, and 11 + 22 = 33. Trump is killed on 7/21, which is 7 + 21 = 28
33 and 28 have the correlation with 2012 and 2017.

Midpoint of July 21st and November 22nd is September 21st, which is the date of Ronald Reagan’s alien speech at the UN. Ronald Reagan was the 40th president, right between 35th president Kennedy and 45th president Trump.

364,Christmas Attack on multiple fronts to USA &amp; Allies,"Russia China Iran axis is hitting back. During the Western holidays we have experienced a coordinated beautifully coreographed but deadly hybrid move which sets a precedent for what we'll have to deal with in the future.

With multiple continents involved, a clear provocation set to signal a worldwide power shift: ""Your days are over Leviathan, you're burning, the Behemoth is rising, the Fenix's light is blinding, your vision is blurring, you are Goliath and I am you David, you are aging, I am growing stronger...""

From Russian submarines above Atlantic fiber optic cables that connect to Europe, to the Lybian attack on the crude pipeline set to bring energy costs up; Migration flow to Europe experiencing a controlled increase; European markets weak &amp; weakened; threats to Israel from Hazbollah, Lebanon; defeats of rebel pockets in Syria; the West getting played by Russia, wake up, Navalny is FSB, a pawn, he might as well be crafted into Putin's successor if they are good enough.



Thoughts on China's (Russia's Iran's) expansionism and imperial undertaking: Why the West's fall from power is bad.

To you, as an individual: I want you to think about the stakes... do not share the view of ""the people are cattle, if Russia, China, Iran conquer us with their sphere of influence our condition will remain unchanged, the world is ruled by few and our individualities, lives are not important in the grand scheme of things""
 Your life will change for the worst (look at Hong Kong). You are a human being, with dignity, rights, your life is of great importance: the collective is made of individuals. Your freedoms will be challenged (it has already started) and you'll be very weak to stop it.
 When you manoeuvre a rocket in space the sooner you do it the less fuel you waste, sometimes you risk running out of fuel and crashing if you don't do it fast enough: do not ignore the issue.
 Why fight against the type of conflict that we're experiencing(2) while also supporting the Western point of view(1)?

1. The ideals of the enlightenment will be fought against, our western moral values as applied to daily life inside our countries will be fought against; when you know that everything is matter, mechanical interactions, economics, then freedom might be looked upon as a 'lie' or an 'illusion';
 the secret of those who control freedom? for the consciousness it is not lie or illusion, nor for our well being; it is this feeling of wanting to change and to act and gain control over the World that shapes our actions and that creates progress, self-improvement. we have learnt through centuries that the collective, the human superorganism that is humanity can achieve the path of progress the most efficiently, even becoming god, if the individual is recognised its worth, if its collective is managed effectively while innovation of thought, science and memory of the past (history) is accessible to all, not restricted to the few or censored, repressed, forgotten.

As things are I can only wish you to 'do not go gentle into that good night'.

 2. Why at all waste time in ""childish"" (for the superorganism at our level of progress) conflicts that seem to exist not to symbiotically (in a mutualistic fashion) or reciprocally better each other, but to assert 'dominance' over oneanother through senseless infinite old dialectics that risk not bringing synthesis but reciprocal destruction and extinction of the human species.

If you ask me personally I do not even support one side over the other, as long as the outcome is not extinction or a new cyclic phase of 'middle ages' in our history, I quite like the game West vs East actually, instinctually, or at least the challenge of it, like you would a match between two sport teams or in a game of chess.

 While reason says one thing emotions sometimes say another, and when we do not have enough information to judge long term behaviour sometimes moral instincts are right. Should the US have nuked the Soviet Union right after WWII? prisoner's dilemma, game theory say 'yes'... but is it correct? long term benefits of collaboration, friendly competition, outweigh continous short term benefits of competition at all costs, especially when what you are competing for is an abundant resource.

 In this case the resource is survival and a good quality of life, their abundance is up for debate. Some might say it is not achievable for all humans if not through world conflict, radical redistribution of world wealth, population control and radical economic restructuring. I judge differently and remark the progress that has been made during the last dacades of globalization, the rise of developing countries, better standard of living in Africa, China itself, can become sustainable in the next century with some more debt and hard work, no risk.


Conclusions? the ideal outcome would be: a sustained growth by China Russia Iran and the rest of the World but, accompanied by a Westernisation of their cultures, with progress sustained not only in the economy but also in society. A change in Western culture that emphasizes even more capitalism, entrepreneurship, collaboration with the ultimate goal of progress and aversion of humanity's extinction; that emphasizes preventing problems before they arise (see healthcare, preventive healthcare vs disease treatment). A global stride for renewable energetic and material resources. Strengthening of organisations such as the European Union and African Union, further bilateral Euroasiatic integration. Economic consolidation in the Americas (better trade agreements, stability in South America), worldwide trade agreements that respect and incentivize the highest standards of products between the countries involved and without the exclusion of key players (China, Russia). Automation which enables a shift to a service economy everywhere, commitment to the arts, to science, by a strong and well functioning middle-class worldwide that drives human progress even further to better control nature, defeating extinction (not only of humanity but of intelligent life, not only of intelligent life but of life itself in its entirety).

Of course that is utopian and flawed, and the course of action will follow the events set in place, nor the West nor the East will make concessions and the fight will go on until a winner between the two is announced. Many will die, more will suffer, as progress in our flawed selves follows cycles, ups and downs, periods of excess and others where to re-establish balance depts have to be repaid be it in money or in potential or in human lives; people will have to endure and hopefully re-emerge stronger from the darkness of our humanity.

Many years ago, I wrote a post on here (now deleted) about how there were so many suicides in my community, on the lonely railroad tracks, that the media finally just stopped reporting them in local news sources. These suicides continue to this day.

What is interesting to me is that many of my conspiracy posts center around kindness, and is that not very telling of where our society is at? In some ways, it is a literally a conspiracy to talk about kindness or the value of human life (and I’ll explain that in this post).

Before anybody says that these types of posts are useless, I would like to remind you of “A Modest Proposal”, a satirical piece written in the 1700s. In this writing, Jonathon Swift proposes killing poor babies to give to the rich for food. It caused outrage, but it also caused changed:

http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html

We must be constantly reflecting on our society. In fact, I would argue that the loss of the art of reflection is what has been breeding a lack of self-awareness and narcissism in our society (though that could be a whole other post).

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/fashion/internet-technology-phones-introspection.html

When I look at our modern society (USA), I see a denial of the value of human life. Maybe people are too comfortable. Maybe they are not aware of the suffering. Maybe they do not value themselves, so it is difficult to value others. There are likely many reasons behind this, and I would like to explore that in this post. Ultimately, when we devalue human life, our world will suffer great consequences - and moreover, so will our souls. 

**Modern Comfort and Modern Suffering**

The world is at our fingertips, yet most of us are not watching videos like this (trigger warning!):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3337cj4sJQ

In this video, kids in Haiti eat mud cookies just so their stomachs feel full. My friend asked me why I would watch such a video, and I told him that it keeps me grounded. I remind myself daily of the true suffering in the world so that I remember what I have, and so that I can give back.

Yet, on a conspiracy forum like this, I rarely see any talk about the poor. Sure, I see the typical, “They just need to work harder” posts, but ultimately I see no discussion of those truly suffering in the world (or very little anyway). 

I have a theory that people either need to suffer themselves or attempt to understand suffering that exists in order to “wake up.” I also have a theory that they keep us very ""comfortable"" in the United States so that we do not think about those who are suffering.

Look, I am not claiming that there are those who are not suffering here, and there are many types of suffering. I would argue, though, that most in this country suffer from excess, not limitations. However, it is extremely important to note that there are third-world-like conditions in the United States that nobody wants to talk about. In other words, I absolutely believe there is suffering here, but I believe that we are “suffering through modern comfort” – an oxymoron perhaps, but let me explain.

In America, many are simply living very comfortable lives:

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hailey-yook/the-american-experience-c_b_1540788.html

http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/opinion/wake-up-america-apathy-can-be-dangerous.html

There is this strange mix of comfort and apathy in our country, even amongst those who do not have much. For those who have, it is easy to feel content and apathetic. For those who do not have, it is easy to seek comfort while remaining apathetic about larger issues. What is strange, though, is even our poor ‘have’ things, but ""these things"" may simply bring more suffering in the end. Let me expand here.

*Comfort?*

Food: More have access to food, but nutritional deficiencies are still a real thing:

https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1987049/boy-nearly-eats-himself-blind-before-mum-discovers-his-poor-diet-was-responsible-for-his-declining-vision/

I cannot tell you how many of my students eat cheetos for lunch, breakfast, and dinner, and we are all aware of the obesity epidemic.

Money: Many feel like they have money, even the poor, but most are drowning in debt:

http://time.com/money/4709270/americans-die-in-debt/

Shelter: Many do not even own houses or property anymore (like me!), but rather they are paying monthly for something they will never really have:

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/harvard-study-heres-how-many-americans-cant-afford-housing.html

Land, homes, and property are becoming things of the past. That is scary if you ever have experienced not having enough rent money.

I would argue that there is this illusion of comfort in our country, and many are eating, buying, and consuming in excess in an effort to feel comfortable. Ultimately, though, they still suffer.

Still, this illusion of comfort stops people from thinking about others in the world who are suffering from NOT having enough.
When people feel this comfort, they can become apathetic to those in need outside of themselves, and this is *the* conspiracy. It is not that people are not suffering in America, rather, it is that they think they are not suffering, and do not seem to care if others are experiencing suffering.

**Dogma and Extremism**

Unfortunately, dogmatic and extremist views in our society are promoting hatred rather than kindness. Wherever you lean politically, I am sure you have seen examples of this. People value their beliefs over love and kindness, and they will do anything for their beliefs.

I want to give a true example of this as a Christian. I am sure many (like I used to be) dislike Christians because they seem to be hypocritical in their teachings. What many Christians refuse to accept is that even Jesus broke the rules when it meant doing what is right and what is loving. In other words, there were times when he undermined the belief systems of the times to promote what was right and good!

The Pharisees often set Jesus up (what a conspiracy), and they invited him to heal a sick man on the Sabbath, thinking he would not because of the traditions of the time.

This is what happened:

“3 Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. 2 Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. 3 Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”

**4 Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.**

5 He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. 6 Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.”

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3:1-6

There are many, many times Jesus “broke the rules” to do what was right and loving.

In our society today, many have become so dogmatic and extreme, that they refuse to look at the individual. I can offer many examples of this.

For one, many group people in categories (which has its necessity at times) rather than looking at individuals themselves. This includes racism, for example. Many look at a person’s race before even considering them as an individual. This is often based on extremism.

We can look at this in another way. Modern feminists (at least SJW/Third/Fourth Wave Feminists) may group all men into a category, before looking at them as an individual. The rules, again, are more important than love.

Or, maybe, we can look at groups like MGTOW or similar ones, who group all women as heathens, rather than looking at them as individuals. Again, even when a woman may break their conceptions, their rules and beliefs may be more important.

I can do this all day. Think about the echo chambers online. People value their rules, their narratives, their traditions, over what is ‘right’ often. This is true in real life as well. 

The point is that people’s dogmas, beliefs, paradigms, and stigmas are what hold them back. I am NOT saying that at times grouping, stereotyping, or categorizing may not serve a purpose. As humans, we must do this daily.

However, when our beliefs overpower doing what is good or right, then our beliefs become our own cage. This is the definition of a paradigm or pattern in our thoughts.

We must have these to function and survive, but we must not forget that our paradigms can be broken.

**The Problem with New Age Beliefs (Just a note!)

When I write about this, I am NOT saying that we should just love everyone and pretend nothing is bad with the world. That seems to be the current problem with the world, actually. 

There are three problems with modern new age beliefs:

1)	They deny the existence of evil.
2)	They twist good and bad (bad can be good or good can be bad).
3)	They state that everything is ‘one’ and there is no distinction.

Though this post is about aliens, I wrote more about this “one love” conspiracy here if you are interested:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=aliens+one+world+deception&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

Evil does exist, and moral relativism is a farce. There is good and bad, and we must not deny that. However, we must do what we can to be kind and make the world a better place, or at least our souls better…

**Abortion? Eugenics?**

This post is about the value of human life, after all, and this is essential to this topic.

Growing up, I bought into third wave feminism, and I literally believed that abortion was empowerment for women. Now, before anybody freaks out, I would never judge a person who has decided to have an abortion for whatever reason. I am not them, and I have no right to judge them, ultimately. Having a baby in today’s society is more difficult than ever.

Still, I am allowed to have morality, and I realize now that abortion is not empowerment. There are thousands of debate resources on abortion, so I am not here to do that. What I am here to do is ask you to question the narrative. Why is abortion viewed as “empowerment?”

https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1498-y

Still, I think abortion is a reflection of something wrong with society, not necessarily the individual. Why do people want to have abortions in an unkind society?

1)	There are more single parents than before:

https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-mysterious-and-alarming-rise-of-single-parenthood-in-america/279203/

2)	The cost of raising a child has risen 40% in the past decade:

http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/21/pf/cost_raising_child/index.htm

3)	Children are seen as burdens:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71

And much more. Our society is sick. It is difficult to value human life when people are so burdened with other issues. Having a child is not a ‘normal’ thing anymore – it is a difficult thing to consider. Further, how can people value a human life when they do not even value their own lives? By the way, keep eugenics in mind for a little later.

**Self-Esteem/Narcissism**

I often write about narcissism, but I wanted to veer in a different direction for this post. There is no doubt that narcissism is on the rise in this society, but could it be that, ultimately, a low-self esteem is what contributes to narcissism in the first place?

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71

In our society, we are told we are NEVER good enough, and we must be constantly comparing ourselves to others. ‘Keeping up with the Joneses’ is nothing new:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses

Whatever the cause of narcissism, there is no doubt that many are feeling lonelier and more disconnected than ever, despite advances in technology. From the article above,

“Along with increased narcissism are also increased levels of loneliness and depression. This makes sense: mature relationships require mutuality, where neither partner is more important than the other. There can be no reciprocal relationship when one partner is self-centered. Egoism pushes others away, thereby leading to loneliness. And being disconnected from others in a meaningful way is a road to depression.”

In fact, youth suicide rates are on the rise:

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/30/youth-suicide-rates-rising-school-and-internet-may-blame/356539001/

and in general, they are on the rise:

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/20/suicide-rates-on-the-rise-in-us-especially-in-rural-areas-cdc/21903238/

And there are many studies on why Americans are so unhappy:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201511/why-adults-are-less-happy-they-used-be

The point is that people have lost the ability to value their own lives because they are constantly being told they do no matter or that they are not important. Usually, they are programmed with these reasons.

Before you dismiss this, just know that all of my students, especially my girls, have no problem telling me how ugly, lonely, fat, desperate, sad, unhappy (insert sad adjective here) they are. They smile on their social media, but they feel so empty. This is anecdotal, I know, but it breaks my heart.

**Eugenics?**

We hear more about ‘diversity’ than ever, but we also hear, more than ever, about the burden of those who are different, whether they have down syndrome, disabilities, or something else.

In a society that values pseudo-intellectualism and scientism, we often dismiss those who are not ‘as smart as we think we are.’

In this video, this man with down syndrome explains to Congress why his life matters:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTbe-u-n0T4&amp;feature=youtu.be

I have written entire posts on eugenics, but I am not going to link them here (unless you ask in the comments). Rather, I want people to think about the distinction between “valuable” life and “invaluable” life. Are only those with a high IQ more valuable? Or are only those who are rich and well-off and well-dressed valuable? Further, are only those “perceived” as smart, or pretty, or handsome, or attractive, or powerful…valuable?

If somebody is born in a world or life that is more difficult than yours, are they any less valuable than you?

To me, we have to remember the importance of the individual and their unique experiences. I believe that everyone has value, and the conspiracy is that 'they' want you to think that only certain people have value (mostly the rich and powerful, and sometimes their “token” feel good stories). Further, they want you to think that only those rich and powerful people can change things (not the guy mentioned earlier with down syndrome).

If we start changing the way we think about the value of human life, and if we even just start thinking of other human lives besides our own, wouldn’t our world be a slightly better place?

I love to subscribe to all types of subreddits, and I rarely comment on others beside conspiracy-related ones. However, the underlying theme, for the most part, is that anybody who might be born with severe disabilities should just be killed before they are born. Yet, these same people preach about diversity and equality. There is something really wrong here.

When I write these types of posts, I never want to undermine anybody’s suffering. We all suffer uniquely, and as the Buddha said,

 **“Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike; each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others too little.”**

Further, there many of you taking care of a suffering family member (or you are suffering yourself). The point is, I am not saying that we should not express the true hardship of the suffering that is real, but we should not undervalue lives that may contribute to suffering.

**Conclusion**

You are valuable, and you matter. We all matter.

The conspiracy is that they want you to believe that we are all equal, but some are more equal than others:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm

What if we changed the word 'equal' to 'valuable'? We are all valuable, and not one soul is more valuable than another soul.
I firmly believe that.

We tend to forget that we are all born as children, and we are molded and shaped by the world around us. I am not dismissing that some become evil, but I want you to think about ‘why’ some become evil.

To end with a quote:

•	A government cannot be truly just without affirming the intrinsic value of human life.
Charles Colson 

And maybe that is the problem. If our world leaders do not think we all have intrinsic human value, then how can anything be better? And if you buy into this belief, that only some have value, then how can this world be better?

434,Discover and Learn the Power of the Truth,"The truth is much more than merely facts and realities. The truth is also a mental key that opens the closed or blocked parts of one’s soul or spiritual self. It’s an energy that enables you to improve yourself. The truth teaches a way of life that channels your energy, mind and will for the greater good.

The truth is also the natural laws, it does not condemn or glorify. It does not demand obedience or worship but it does balance out one’s life and the world when we are loyal to it.

The power of the truth can be discovered and it can be learned. You can discover it by seeing its effects in your daily life, often even on a very personal level. It can be learned by studying and harnessing its nature.

The power of the truth can be destructive for those who seek to contain it and for those who do not understand its full potential.

When the truth is being used in evil schemes it will eventually destroy those who want to thrive in darkness through evil. But also when the truth is being misunderstood or only applied partially one can get squashed by it because its power is totally overwhelming.

One either stands fully with the truth or not at all. Standing with the truth only now and then or only for financial gains will get one crushed. It will lead one to travel on the paths of misdirection and deception. Paths that only lead to enslavement and the entire demise of self-determination.

But the truth can also be constructive, it can be used to build amazing things that mankind has already partially achieved. Truth can also bring happiness, justice, health, wealth, freedom, enlightenment, hope, love, joy and satisfaction.

The truth may very well be the purpose of human life for without it our lives are completely meaningless.

448,Nickelodeon star murdered,"Crazy as it sounds Im convinced about it. The girl that is showned as Amanda Bynes is not her at all. If you google Amanda BYnes 2017 all the photos of her of a fatter girl wearing glasses and is always next to another woman that it looks like a guard or something weird. If you look at the last of interview of  amanda Bynes it really sounds fake,the girl is an actress and her profile is always showed,you never see a front angle of her face. The  instagram of her only shows 13 pictures which are most of them old.

i remember that the girl went crazy and post crazy things on twitter.. I really believe that she was going to expose Dan Schneider and she was murdered.

The mother of Janette Macurdy died too and I read somewhere that she acussed nickelodeon of pedo stuff too. 

remember that not along time ago Jamie Lyn Spears daughter was hurt in an accident.. what if it wasnt an accident? what if somebody try to hurt the girl to shut up the spears family?

what about the photos of vanessa hudgens and janette mcurdy that were leaked? probablly these pictures were taked by pedo nickelodeon producers.

I never watched zoey101,victorius of all those shows because Im older that those stars,Im here because of crazy days and nights website.

not a coincidence that all the disney stars become crazy..

this is my theory: all this disney nickelodeon spierlberg kids were abuse. These kids didnt knew what abuse was because they grow up there,it was common so they thought it was something natural. They never questionate anything. Those child stars dont even used to go to school,they probablly had tutors on set. So.. when they go out to the real world they realized that they were abused and that they were sold by their parents so imagine what a shock right? to discover that your parents sold you as hamburgers to get money so that is why they end up so messed up.. the reality hits. They canot say the truth because they are going to be considered  crazy or drugadicts and if they speak they probally are going to get murdered. And the ones that become big stars .. the ones that make it in mtv like britney,ariana,christina etc? well they and their families probally know about all this but they preffer look to the other side and continuing keeping the secret as the money continue to show up. imagine if you were in that position what would you do? would you go against a giant as nickeloden,mtv spielberg or would you shut up and close your eyes to get your paycheck? money moves everything.. probally all the people on nickeloden sets knew about dan schneider pedo things but the look to the other side oterwise they would lose their jobs.

backstory- I have had 2 miscarriages within the past 6 months. I was told after the fist miscarriage that it was just bad luck, things just happen... Im currently extremely lucky to have two beautiful children who are both currently toddlers- because of this was told not to Worry about it. Fast forward 5 months to this most recent pregnancy - go to my doctor for my first trimester ultrasound to find I have another miscarriage.. my dr seemed very distraught- I am very close to her and i assumed it was because she saw how devastated we were. 

But...

I went in for a checkup after initial appointment and my main dr was unavailable so the other Dr at the practice checked on me and became visibly distraught. She then hesitantly told me that within the last 2 months they have not had 1 viable pregnancy. That within all of their years of practice this has never happened and it’s been heartbreaking. 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage... the dr was crying when she looked at my ultra sound and said it makes no sense how their office was filled with the 20%..

It may be my hormones going crazy and making me crazy.. but I have been wondering if this is going on anywhere else? 


TLDR: suffered two recent miscarriages within past several months- doctor, who was visibly upset, told me their office hasn’t had a viable pregnancy in at least 2 months and they have no idea why. ",conspiracy,1514378022,Otisbolognis,31,35,True,2017-12-27

38,"Jeff Bezos: ""Kingpin"" AI assistant","I happened across a character at Amazon who was working on machine learning for the executive branch. Specifically, for Jeff Bezos himself. This AI ""daily world briefing at a glance"" was called 'Kingpin'. 

Amazon executives traditionally received daily briefings compiled in the form of ""[x]-pagers"" (ie one-pagers, five-pagers, etc.). Bezos has a strong tendency to promote the concept of writing ideas down in stone, from his time with books. Amazon decided to put it's machine learning knowledge to use by creating a dedicated machine learning/neural network assistant to crawl the entire web, stock markets, news releases, internal company reports, calendars etc. and to summarize these points into the desired briefing length for the day. 

Bezos would then meet (or teleconference) with other high level executives and discuss the daily points of this briefing. This provides an extremely valuable level of intelligence because Kingpin can crawl multiple data sources (the only technical details I know were about normalizing these different data streams) at a mind-bogglingly fast rate compared to a normal assistant (or team of assistants). 

Bezos has recently passed $100B net worth, and his acquisitions of Washington Post, Whole Foods, and their secure service for US government uses have seemed like extreme successes (whether morally agreeable or not). Kingpin clearly seems to be working. What does this mean about what other business executives might be working on? Why would Zuckerberg (who talks about creating his own ""Jarvis"") or Sergey Brin or Bill Gates not have the same?

To clarify, this AI is not smart. It is a statistical whiz-kid which evaluates billions of possible discussion points and creates the most concise summary which touches on every important event for the day. But that speed and breadth is extremely, extremely valuable to someone with so much scale under their control. 

Is this the future? A ('dumb') AI selecting which articles are of importance in our daily news-feed? Using AI for information compression is a very important thing as we already know from comment bots which summarize articles. 

Jeff Bezos is ready for the future. How will you outpace him? ",conspiracy,1511629394,bezos_kingpin,14,43,True,2017-11-25

68,Templar's City of London Corporation,"The City of London Corporation is a one mile square block in London where the 110 Livery Companies operate from. The 110 Livery Companies represent every industry in the global market. Most major corporations today are connected with the Livery Companies through proxies or subsidiaries. Business at the City of London is mostly private and they conceal ownership through private contracts. The Knights Templar of London were headquartered at the inner temple of the City of London and today are the Order of the Garter headed by the British royal family and British Peerage. The City of London Corporation, Knights Templar, and Order of the Garter all use the same red cross as a symbol. The Knights Templar were merchants and bankers that held gold for pilgrims who traveled to Jerusalem and provided them with bank notes which were used at the Templar's merchant shops along the way. The Knights Templar established modern banking. London merchants have a monopoly on gold and silver which they use as leverage over the markets and monetary system. They also manipulate the price of gold and silver from London. This Templar merchant and banking system is rigged and functions like covert monopolies through hidden corporate conglomerates. Many universities, banks, and merchant companies are connected to the charters that were issued from the City of London Corporation. Some merchant and banking families that operate in London include the Grosvenor, Goldsmith, Rothschild, Montagu, Norman, Guinness, Sassoon, and Barclay families.

Foreign members of the Order of the Garter include King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Harald V of Norway, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Emperor Akihito of Japan. They are members of the Order of the Garter because they covertly do business in London. The United States is a federal corporation defined under US code 3002 section 15 and is really a continuation of the Virginia Company. The Virginia Company was issued by the British Crown from the City of London Corporation for North American settlements. Former Governor of the Bank of England Baron Montagu Norman helped to established the Bank for International Settlements and worked with Nazi businessmen. They are using the Bank for International Settlements as a proxy to steal from corporate governments through foreign tax contracts like the Belgian Scheldt Dues.  They then launder and conceal the wealth in private Swiss bank accounts. Washington DC was established as a municipal corporate state and headquarters of the United States through the 1871 District of Columbia Organic Act based on debts owed to foreign entities like the Hudson Bay Company, Irish Government, and Kingdom of Belgium. Prince Lorenz of Belgium works at Gutzwiller bank in Basel Switzerland right near the Bank for International Settlements and is overseeing the private accounts of the royal and noble families.

body floated one night, very vibrant/first person view dream of rising up with mountains in a huge plane, thousands of ethereal beings floating around 2 intense red lights in the sky beings were indistinguishable at the centers, every being had a red heart red veins through their body with lots in their heads one came through an invisible barrier between us and morphed into a beautiful human like being stared at me a few seconds was very excited to see me (a detail I'd forgotten recently whenever I explained the dream that is pretty important was that from above there were huge screens on top of the mountains showing people's smiling faces, means that what I was seeing was probably created/affected largely by my mind cuz there's fkin huge TVs on mountains, that's not natural.) 

lucid dream of shiny pink/like ultraviolet 4:44 (3 years ago), lucid dream of something that looked like a DNA strand being created and fell apart when I became aware and woke up, sometimes I could see my room when I'd close my eyes this is after looot of meditation and PTB were fucking pissed after I meditated so much, some targeted individual researchers believe remote viewing or OBEs are achievable only through technology, I think we can strengthen our brainwaves/conductivity through meditation and mess with their technology or whatever makes this phenomena happen, it might be a natural thing since the universe existed cuz PTB care too much about rituals, symbols and never let me meditate anymore by inducing pain in my body and wtf is up with dreams, dreams in general are fucking weird.  

woken up by a reallyyyy creepy voice saying I made a song for you, another night by a loud and low tone voice yelling I can take it all away. Increased anger, depression, suicidal feelings for a while along with seeing white flashes in the air and an infection I've never had in my life, stopped meditating

closed eyes one day and saw like a zoomed in remote-viewing image of a tiny crawling insect, not sure what remote viewing is supposed to look like but I'm guessing they wanted me to think this insect is in my body and I'm looking at it cuz I got spiritual powaa (/s) I'd say lucid dream if I was sleeping but it was like a gif of a very real looking insect under a microscope and I wasn't sleeping  

like 2 months before I found out I'm targeted saw a very clear eye of Horus when I closed my eyes, white symbol on black background lasted for like 3 seconds 

very real looking/1st person view dream of being tied, crying and begging to not be killed, goddess sophia asked if I suffered as she was looking at a dagger in her hand to see if it's sharp enough, I said a little she stabbed me in my neck quick, was the same night when they squeezed my heart, spoke through me, voice said hi I asked his name he said James, another voice asked what do I want (later an alternative media bullshitter I used to follow would say that's what Michael Aquino asks to do his mk-ultra thing) I asked was I abducted it said yes I asked how many times it said 17 times, I was into Gnosticism at the time and prayed before I went to sleep cuz of all the crap that went on that week, it's strange that a 'spiritual experience' would happen so quick without hallucinogenics or meditation and happens the same night after so much other programming 

when they controlled my brainwaves to talk through me or the 'reptilian possession' was cuz I read a bullshit alternative media article by Eve Lorgen which she's updated since, heart squeezing was one of the reptilian possession 'symptoms', felt heavy pressure under my scalp that could control my eye movement, they increased my nervousness by a lot along with white flashes in the air, gangstalking and street theater was set at max for a month or so, voices in previous paragraph happen and I'm just sitting there freaked the fuck out waiting for next programming, I blurt out 'need to be punished' I just realize they're doing a possession thing, I had fake anxiety and thought they're gonna kill me anyway so I thought what the hell and asked what do I do for fame/money they made me say blood sex strength. Few mins later they made me say things like I knew you were coming so I went to your dad a long time ago, bitch I see you don't tell anyone, everyone's gonna need you, feel you, see you, need you, feel you, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

for about 4 months after they induce lot of pain in my body till I type in google one day I won't go crazy, next day I hear someone say why you stopped it and another voice said she said she's not going crazy

in shiny pink/ultraviolet again, tall blonde guy with staff I want to say pleiadian looking fellow or ashtar command lol but that's just the programming, appeared in my mind's eye we communicated by emotions said bad guys are like a snake couldn't understand snake so he showed me a snake gif (I understand that's one of their favorite mk-ultra symbols and there's lot of cults with snakes) also said keep doing what you do wake people up bla bla, (I wonder if when it was my turn to talk they controlled my thoughts a bit, wtf do you ask a pink guy in your head, cuz I was into aliens at the time, obviously a distraction)

couple months later UFO above UN building that's really near my house, was on my roof randomly, white light orb lit up when I looked in it's direction, off when I went to go back and back on when I looked back before I left...retarded for forgetting my camera never saw a UFO before and was too excited.

Gnostics felt an entity controls the universe that can be good or bad and seeked too much spiritual experiences. Ayahuasca shows you your inner self, inner struggles, inner demons, can change how you view life and not everyone needs it. After lot of meditation most importantly I noticed synchronicities in my life and people around me, my best friend's dreams were synching with mine and we can communicate words telepathically, I was in a very good place mentally/physically didn't know about targeting and am harassed for meditating ever since or when I try to control energy around me with my mind (can heal/move clouds/negate some torture)

There's some truth in Gnosticism but it's probably a cover too, there's a line in bible that says Satan get behind me, I was doing so much better/was more focused on my path when I didn't feel like a victim, before I knew about their weapons and harassment methods, because I knew there's something very wrong with this place and I shouldn't underestimate my enemy so I couldn't avoid finding out how evil they are and being where I am, I have to suck it up and be stronger or there's no or. There's something very wrong with this place and hope can be our strongest weapon in that how we perceive our life and struggles affects how our life and struggles turn out. We can be overwhelmed by fear created by PTB and give up or choose to perceive things differently and enjoy all life has to offer. It's interesting in DMT trips or near death experiences people report seeing geometric shapes that look like designs in some mosques, the researcher talking about geometric shapes was also talking about how the universe automatically makes these experiences happen when people are in certain brain states like the universe is governed by something intelligent. 

either spiritual experiences are governed by our minds and have happened since the universe existed and PTB imitate experiences to confuse people and make their desired reality happen easier by showing certain symbols for example, or this intelligence taking people on DMT trips and whatnot is wholly malevolent and isn't natural like an artificial intelligence. 

I think spirit realm is intertwined with this world (as above so below) and PTB use their knowledge to create their desired reality and confuse masses about true spirituality, it's not meditating everyday and hoping for spiritual experiences, it's understanding how everything's connected, a magical act of using every part of your being to change reality to your desires, more people have more effect so PTB got this reality all confused with weird religions, beliefs and ways of living and threaten whoever they control to keep their knowledge hidden. I won't believe non-human entities have power over me, I know they can induce scary sounds and possessions by tech and if there are entities they're all or mostly good cuz TPTB try way too hard to make their desires happen and good just feels natural, I think humans play a huge role in how these entities act and I could control this Satan or whatever boogie monster that's on my mind at the time if I wanted plus there are more good people than bad, bad can seem to have the upper hand cuz they keep important knowledge hidden but everything's being revealed cuz our collective desire. 

Why don't PTB just kill me instead of spend so much resources/time on harassing me? so you agree PTB doesn't like some people and doesn't have a problem with killing them but harassing them is too much, why do shills try to debate so hard that PTB doesn't give a shit about harassing people, to me it's obvious the harassment's been going on for a loong time and PTB have just been creating better and better methods to control with religion, borders, wars, languages, internet, overflow of info/muddy waters/not easy to wake up after thousand years of confusion I get it

there was also a small pedo incident at like age 13 in US nothing traumatic just interesting that it kinda ties in to pizzagate/mk-ultra stuff and some other small incidents mostly my family was harassed till I got older, all the stuff I wrote except pedo incident happened in Tehran. When I was in Maryland and North Carolina at 19/20 and didn't know I was targeted yet they used tech to make my family fight a lot very fake intense emotions over nothing, stalked me a lot and would sexually stimulate me during sleep with family in next room so I'd feel humiliated. Haven't had any experiences with entities or w/e for about a year just tortured when I do stuff that's good like read, more when I meditate and lot more when my posts gain attention, worst/recent harassment for something I wrote was made me black out, I found out next day couldn't remember going to sleep, saw evidence that they'd controlled me to do something and erased my memory of doing it, suddenly it made sense why they kept repeating 'baby' when they possessed me. 

sometimes I worry that they're gonna control me to do something really horrible and erase my memory of doing it or even suicide, am telling friends who I trust about their tech though and that I'd never suicide.

185,"Pedophilia case in Europe: Judge and Politicians involved. Corruption, murders and coverups.","The story takes place in Lithuania, member of NATO and the European Union. It revolves around a little girl who was living with her father after the divorce of her parents (the mother accepted the terms, getting visitation rights on the weekends). In 2008 the girl’s father (Drasius Kedys) filed a police report that his daughter is being molested by the mother’s friend Andrius Usas, a businessman, an advisor to the speaker of the house. In 2009 the father submitted a formal complaint to the police that there were two other men involved - Jonas Furmonavicius (a judge) and another man Aidas (unidentified), while another girl was abused as well and both mother knew about it, and had financial gain from it.  No charges were filled. The father filed hundreds of reports and requests to the prosecutors, judges, congressmen and the president. He recorded his daughters testimony and sent it to hundreds of media outlets and the European politicians. The story was gaining some small traction online and in the independent media.  Later that year judge Furmonavicius and the second girl’s mother Naruseviciene were shot. Drasius Kedys became the main suspect. The story caught attention of the media and the public. Protests started throughout the country, blaming prosecutors for inactivity. The case was finally officially started. Kedy’s sister, judge Venckiene gained the custody of the girl. While the second girl disappeared. In 2010 the police announced that Kedys is hiding in Spain. The next day, his body was found in Kaunas, Lithuania. The official report of his death was that Kedys choked on his vomit while heavily drinking. His family and most of the nation did not believe this report. There were clear signs of violence on his body. His funeral was attended by around 10000 Lithuanians. Later the same year the court decided that the girl should live with her mother (while testifying against her). At the same time the main suspect Andrius Usas, fell of his bike and drowned in a creek. When girl refused to go to her mother, the court allowed police to take the girl by force. Hundreds of Lithuanians surrounded the house of the girl’s aunt, judge Venckiene and stayed there for more than two years, preventing the police from taking the girl. On March 23rd, 2012, during one of the visits from the girl’s mother, the police showed up and tried to take the girl by force, the mother was pulling the girl away from the grandmother, the girl was screaming “go away”. This attempt failed and caused a huge outrage threw out the country and the world. There were protests by the Government buildings in Lithuania and abroad. On May 17th, 240 police officers with riot gear, blocked the radius of the house for 2 miles, closed down the local school and shut down the roads. The police got threw the protesters, broke the glass door and carried the girl away screaming. The judge Venckiene’s legal immunity was violated, because the officers detained her by holding her arms. 39 other people were arrested, including the girl’s grandmother. Thousands of Lithuanians protested by the Presidential palace. At the time the President of Lithuania was in Chicago, at a NATO summit, the protesters surrounded her car, and did not let her pass. Soon after, 6 charges were brought against judge Venckiene (there are speculations that the president viewed her as a potential political threat). In 2013 Venckiene resigned and was elected to congress with a new political party that gained 8% of the votes, while having almost 0 funding. The same charges were brought against her, plus one additional crime. The parliament voted to remove her legal immunity and to allow to arrest her. She fled the country and asked for political asylum in United States. She was soon impeached from her congress seat, many members of her party and supporters are facing charges from refusing to obey a court order to a threat to the national security. Venckiene has been in U.S. for 5 years now. Lithuanian government asked for her extradition, the number of crimes grew to 39. The girl is missing. The grandparents are on trial for “psychological molestation” for asking the girl about what happened at the mom’s house. Kedy’s friend is sentenced to 8 years in jail for assisting in the killing. There are around 10 people that died who were related to this case, all of Venckiene’s family and supporters are being trialled and the story is being killed in the media.

201,"Gorka on Uranium One Deal: 'If This Had Happened in the 1950s, There Would Be People Up on Treason Charges Right Now'","HANNITY: Let me bring former deputy assistant to President Trump, Sebastian Gorka. I did mean to introduce you, and I just got ahead of myself, as I often do. I apologize. Dr. Gorka, I want to look big picture here. And I thought Sarah Sanders said this very well, and I take it a step further. Everything that they tried to say about Donald Trump and his campaign, they’re guilty of. But I’ll add on steroids and human growth hormones. That they sold out America’s security in this case. Give me the big picture take away from this because now the media has gone silent on Russia, virtually silent.

GORKA: Here’s the big picture take away, Sean. For more than a year, the fake news industrial complex, and the Democrats, and Hillary, and Podesta, and Ben Rhodes, have been slinging filth against the president and against his team. None of it has stuck. But in the last week, we’ve had an explosion of scandals that all are true and that all go back to the DNC and to Hillary. And the trouble is, Sean, you have to do a massive service because you’re the only people. It’s you, it’s Sarah, it’s Solomon, it’s Peter, but that’s it. And there’s so many scandals. We have to separate them.

Number one, there’s the Uranium One deal. That’s treasonous, OK? We have to deal with that. Second, there’s the doggie dossier which is about Russian disinformation being used to slander Donald Trump. And then, thirdly, there’s James Comey using that disinformation to create a special prosecutor trigger that is used to investigate the president. And then, lastly, the fourth story is Fusion GPS. How many stories are out there that are fake that came from Moscow, and which were peddled by Fusion GPS into the left wing media. That’s four scandals in one week, Sean.

HANNITY: The Russians lied to impact the election. The Russian infiltrated our national security to corner the uranium market and they succeeded, and they knew all the crimes that were committed.

GORKA: If this had happened in the 1950s, there would be people up on treason charges right now. The Rosenberg’s, OK? This is equivalent to what the Rosenberg’s did, and those people got the chair. Think about it. Giving away nuclear capabilities to our enemies, that’s what we’re talking about.

HANNITY: All right. Last word, our friend, Peter.

SCHWEIZER: Well, look, I think it’s going to be amazingly important for that information to be preserved by the FBI. I think this eyewitness needs to be protected. And I think we’re going to see a lot more coming out on Clinton pay to play. I think Gregg Jarrett is right.

232,Does anybody have an articulate case AGAINST our country falling victim to cultural Marxism?,"FYI THIS IS A CONSPIRACY RELATED POST BECAUSE FRANKLY, FEW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF WHAT CULTURAL MARXISM IS. 

I can't help but feel our country's lack of unity is due to far left (and I mean FAR LEFT, not your uncle Steve who's a democrat because he's union) implementation of  identity politics capitalizing on the tiny things that make us different and making mountains out of molehills with them. 

With the mass release of info regarding Elsagate, pedophiles/sexual predators in power, rampant gender dysphoria, the free access to unlimited pornography, bought and paid for politicians from both parties, mass human trafficking, mainstream drug/alcohol abuse, where did it all come from?

Cultural Marxism was put in place by communist social scientists (Gramsci, Lukacs, Frankfurt school, etc) in American universities from 1950 on, to tear away the very foundation that this beautiful country was founded on and I fear that many of the crazy shit happening right now is a direct product of CM. 

Main objectives:
1. Destroy the country's faith in Christianity
2. Destroy the family unit
3. Introduction of critical theory (basically stripping away any sense of ""truth"")everything is subjective and even if something has worked for a very long time you should seek to endlessly criticize it. 

We send 18 year olds off to indoctrination facilities (universities) and they come out less talented/productive than when they went in. Entering with a somewhat thirst for knowledge and leaving with a hatred/lack of understanding of their own culture and a useless gender studies degree quite often accompanied by a $40,000.00 plus bill. 

For 4-8 years they are told that White equals evil and anything that is the minority is automatically oppressed. We are taught to laugh at and criticize Christianity while simultaneously taught to accept Islam.  

It is without a doubt this country was founded on the fundamental values supplied by the Christian faith, obviously we have freedom of religion but to argue this country was not founded by Christians is crazy talk. 

Less than 250 years later here we are funding the mass immigration of Muslims (the likes of which were also flooded into Europe, and are now on the verge of causing civil wars in France, Germany, and destroying countries such as Sweden.)

In 2016 the state of Minnesota spent $103,000,000 of TAXPAYER money flooding thousands of Muslim Somalians into small towns in Minnesota (if that's not a conspiracy I don't know what is. 

Anybody with a brain can tell you that a midwestern citizen of America is not going to jive with somebody who beats his wife, rapes children, and walks all over the American flag. 

Obviously not every Somalian Muslim has evil intentions but when they come from a country that has an average IQ of 68 (when we consider less than 70 mentally handicapped here in the states) and they follow a teaching such as the Muslim faith, they can easily be coerced into doing evil while believing they are just. 

The United States is a shining beacon of freedom in the world and there is no country that even comes close to guaranteeing the individual freedom of every law abiding man or woman. 

So why is social media so anti American? Could it be the very social media outlets you use are not only owned by far left globalist supporters, but they use it as a tool to indoctrinate the youth even further? 

When did it become wrong to LOVE this country with every bone in your body? Why are you considered a monster if you believe marriage was created for a man and woman? Why are real men getting harder and harder to find? 

What do you think will happen to our country if we keep emasculating men while simultaneously importing 4th generation warfare, jihad spreading, non Muslim stabbing, fighting age males? 

 When chaos manifests its self in front of you and it will, if you are incapable of producing the correct amount of  violence to not only match but overpower the threat you will be swallowed whole, such is life/nature and has been for millions of years. 

No matter what the media will ever tell you, when it comes time to defend this country once again from true evil whether it be foreign or domestic, the ONLY thing that will save us is the sacrifice of freedom loving, family having, God fearing, American men. Just as they have time and time again. 

I know I'll catch some hate for this post because some people are simply too ignorant to recognize how truly wonderful the United States is but I really don't care.

If you think otherwise I would love to hear so because like I said freedom of speech and ideas is one of this country's guiding strengths.

255,Accusations of pedophilia are becoming a weapon to destroy people.,"Now, before we start, a resounding YES, pedophiles are the most vile people on earth.  I wholeheartedly agree that adults who prey on children should be put away for a long time.  In fact, for life if it's multiple offenses.


But I also see a different trend.  I see that pedophilia (along with sexual abuse in general) is the one crime where public opinion will always be *you are guilty* even though no real evidence exists.  It's disconcerting at the least.  I mean, if you are accused of stealing or even murdering, people generally have no problem with assuming you are innocent until proven guilty.  (well, except for those cases where the evidence is OVERWHELMING, like with OJ)  But with pedophiles?  It's different.  It brings out emotions in people that hasn't been seen since Salem and the Inquisition.    If you are even ACCUSED of being a pedophile, your life is over.  That's it.  End of story.  


Now, if it stopped there, I wouldn't have such a huge problem.  But I'm noticing something else as well.  People are calling those accused of sexual contact (not even intercourse but just nudity or lewdness) with anyone under 18 pedophiles.    Now, I realize that I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this, but a pedophile is someone who engages in sexual acts with adolescents before or during puberty.  Not with 16 and 17 year olds.    In fact, it's even legal to have sex with teens aged 17 in all states (16 in some).  The only point I'm trying to make is that people have been told over and over again that pedophiles are pure evil.  So, to destroy people, we label them pedophiles.  And that label is all that matters.  You don't get a trial.  You don't get to refute.  Once you're labeled, it's over.    Does anyone get what I'm getting at here?


I realize I'm gonna get shit for this post.  I realize that most of you will hate me, EVEN THO I'M NOT DEFENDING PEDOPHILES IN ANY SHAPE, FORM, OR MATTER.  But if anything, how you feel about my post should tell you something.  Why are you so triggered with my post?  Have you been programmed?  Are you a tool of this weapon?  Are you just a voice that the people in power use to destroy their opposition?  I don't know.  When did we become programmed to think that pedophiles are worse than murderers?

It includes such delicious tidbits and hors d'oeuvre as this. &lt;clink&gt; cheers, and remember Jeff Bezos was/is a member of the Koch created/driven A.L.E.C.   so fuck off with the idea that Bezos is supporting liberals. 

The tidbit, for our national orgy of eating and familial horror show: 
&gt;**No wonder Michael Flynn decided to cut a deal with Robert n the twenty-four hours since Michael Flynn revealed that he’s decided to cut a deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller,** 

&gt;the biggest questions have centered around how this will impact everyone else in the Trump-Russia scandal, particularly Donald Trump. In the background, a secondary question has also been looming: why did Flynn decide to cut a deal? Why now? Why not last month or next month? What happened? Now we’re getting some of those answers.

&gt;Over the past two weeks we’ve seen the media expose that the government of Turkey allegedly offered Michael Flynn a $15 million bribe in exchange for his help in kidnapping a cleric in Pennsylvania. The kidnapping story is several months old, but the bribery angle is new, and it makes the whole thing a much more serious criminal conspiracy. We’ve also seen Reza Zarrab, federal prisoner awaiting trial for criminally conspiring with Turkey, vanish from his own trial as Mueller apparently scooped him up to testify against Flynn. Now it turns out there’s more.

&gt;Tonight the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Robert Mueller is investigating Michael Flynn for his role in making a propaganda documentary for the government of Turkey (link). Flynn was taking payments from Turkey that were illegal to begin with because he concealed them from the U.S. government, meaning that he’s criminally liable for all of the work he did for Turkey. This reveals that Mueller has been probing every inch of work that Flynn has done, and was planning to nail Flynn for all of it unless he cut a deal. But there’s one other detail in play.

&gt;That same WSJ article makes clear that Michael Flynn’s son was involved in the kidnapping and bribery conspiracy plot with Turkey. This finally spells out just how much legal trouble the younger Flynn is facing – and getting his son off the hook is likely the real reason Flynn decided to cut a deal.

282,"After 30 Years, Alarmists Are Still Predicting A Global Warming ‘Apocalypse’","For at least three decades scientists and environmental activists have been 
warning that the world is on the verge of a global warming “apocalypse” that 
will flood coastal cities, tear up roads and bridges with mega-storms and bring 
widespread famine and misery to much of the world.

The only solution, they say, is to rid the world of fossil fuels — coal, natural 
gas and oil — that serve as the pillars of modern society. Only quick, decisive 
global action can avert the worst effects of manmade climate change, warn 
international bodies like the United Nations, who say we only have decades left 
— or even less!

Of course, human civilization has not collapsed, despite decades of predictions 
that we only have years left to avert disaster. Ten years ago, the U.N. 
predicted we only had “as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global 
average rise of 2C or more.”

This failed prediction, however, has not stopped the U.N. and others from 
issuing more apocalyptic statements.

To celebrate nearly three decades of dire predictions, The Daily Caller News 
Foundation put together this list of some of the most severe doomsday prophecies 
made by scientists, activists and politicians:

* 1. Apocalyptic warnings on repeat

A group of 1,700 scientists and experts signed a letter 25 years ago warning of 
massive ecological and societal collapse if nothing was done to curb 
overpopulation, pollution and, ultimately, the capitalist society in which we 
live today.

The Union of Concerned Scientists put out a second letter earlier this year, 
once again warning of the dire consequences of global warming and other alleged 
ecological ills. Now numbering 15,000, the group warns “soon it will be too late 
to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out.”

“We must recognize, in our day-to-day lives and in our governing institutions, 
that Earth with all its life is our only home,” the scientists and experts 
warned.

It’s a terrifying warning — if you ignore the fact that none of their 1992 
warning has come to fruition.

* 2. The planet will be “uninhabitable” by the end of the century

New York Magazine writer David Wallace-Wells published a 7,000-word article 
claiming global warming could make Earth “uninhabitable” by “the end of this 
century.”

Wallace-Wells’s article warned of terrors, like “Heat Death,” “Climate Plagues,” 
“Permanent Economic Collapse” and “Poisoned Oceans.”

“Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their 
lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other 
parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century,” 
Wallace-Wells wrote.

* 3. Prince Charles’s global warming deadline passed…and nothing happened

Prince Charles famously warned in July 2009 that humanity had only 96 months to 
save the world from “irretrievable climate and ecosystem collapse, and all that 
goes with it.” That deadline has passed, and the prince has not issued an update 
to when the world needs to be saved.

Though the recently-released “Paradise Papers” show Charles lobbied U.K. 
lawmakers to enact policies that benefited his estate’s investment in a Bermuda 
company that does sustainable forestry. So, there’s that.

* 4. ‘Ice Apocalypse’ Now

Liberal writer and climate scientist Eric Holthaus claimed manmade global 
warming would set off the “ice apocalypse” at a pace “too quickly for humanity 
to adapt.”

Holthaus warned the wholesale collapse of two Antarctic glaciers — Pine Island 
and Thwaites — could happen sooner than previously believed, resulting in 
“flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.” 
Sounds terrible, but his conclusions aren’t really backed up by the science.

“I think his article is too pessimistic: that it overstates the possibility of 
disaster. Too soon, too certain,” Tamsin Edwards, a scientist who’s studied 
Antarctica, wrote in The Guardian about Holthaus’s article.

* 5. 2015 is the ‘last effective opportunity’ to stop catastrophic warming

World leaders meeting at the Vatican  issued a statement saying that 2015 was 
the “last effective opportunity to negotiate arrangements that keep 
human-induced warming below 2-degrees [Celsius].”

Pope Francis wants to weigh in on global warming, and is expected to issue an 
encyclical saying basically the same thing. Francis reiterated that 2015 is the 
last chance to stop massive warming.

But what he should really say is that the U.N. conference is the “last” chance 
to cut a deal to stem global warming…since last year when the U.N. said 
basically the same thing about 2014’s climate summit.

* 6. France’s foreign minister said we only have “500 days” to stop “climate 
chaos”

When Laurent Fabius met with Secretary of State John Kerry on May 13, 2014 to 
talk about world issues he said “we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos.”

Ironically at the time of Fabius’ comments, the U.N. had scheduled a climate 
summit to meet in Paris in December 2015 — some 565 days after his remarks. 
Looks like the U.N. is 65 days too late to save the world.

* 7. Former President Barack Obama is the last chance to stop global warming

When Obama made the campaign promise to “slow the rise of the oceans,” some 
environmentalists may have taken him quite literally.

The United Nations Foundation President Tim Wirth told Climatewire in 2012 that 
Obama’s second term was “the last window of opportunity” to impose policies to 
restrict fossil fuel use. Wirth said it’s “the last chance we have to get 
anything approaching 2 degrees Centigrade,” adding that if “we don’t do it now, 
we are committing the world to a drastically different place.”

Even before that, then-National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard 
Space Flight Center head James Hansen warned in 2009 that Obama only “has four 
years to save Earth.”

* 8. Remember when we had “hours” to stop global warming?

World leaders met in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2009 to potentially hash out another 
climate treaty. That same year, the head of Canada’s Green Party wrote that 
there was only “hours” left to stop global warming.

“We have hours to act to avert a slow-motion tsunami that could destroy 
civilization as we know it,” Elizabeth May, leader of the Greens in Canada, 
wrote in 2009. “Earth has a long time. Humanity does not. We need to act 
urgently. We no longer have decades; we have hours. We mark that in Earth Hour 
on Saturday.”

* 9. United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there was only 50 days left 
to save Earth

The year 2009 was a bad time for global warming predictions. That year Brown 
warned there was only “50 days to save the world from global warming,” the BBC 
reported. According to Brown there was “no plan B.”

Brown has been booted out of office since then.

* 10. The U.N.’s top climate scientist said in 2007 we only had four years to save 
the world

Rajendra Pachauri, the former head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change said in 2007 that if “there’s no action before 2012, that’s too late.”

“What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future. This is 
the defining moment,” he said.

Well, it’s 2017 and no new U.N. climate treaty has been presented. The only 
thing that’s changed since then is that Pachauri was forced to resign earlier 
this year amid accusations he sexually harassed multiple female coworkers.

* 11. Environmentalists warned in 2002 the world had a decade to go green

Environmentalist write George Monbiot wrote in the UK Guardian that within “as 
little as 10 years, the world will be faced with a choice: arable farming either 
continues to feed the world’s animals or it continues to feed the world’s 
people. It cannot do both.”

About 930 million people around the world were undernourished in 2002, according 
to U.N. data. By 2014, that number shrank to 805 million. Sorry, Monbiot.

* 12. Global warming apocalypse 1980s edition

The U.N. was already claiming in the late 1980s that the world had only a decade 
to solve global warming or face the consequences.

The San Jose Mercury News reported June 30, 1989 that a “senior environmental 
official at the United Nations, Noel Brown, says entire nations could be wiped 
off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed 
by the year 2000.”

That prediction didn’t come true 17 years ago, and the U.N. is sounding the same 
alarm today.

302,Concerning deleted Wikipedia articles,"

Guys, with the number of real conspiracies going under way, it's important not to dilute actual signs of misinformation or coverup with quick validation of ""signs"" of coverups. Specifically I want to talk Wikipedia deleted posts. 

Wikipedia is a great resource and one of the genuine bastions of information that remains free from corporate control. When they delete an article, there is always a log, a community disucssion and a reason for deletion - citing the original posting user, the user who nominated it for deletion. These are searchable and exhaustive. Consider the one for the [deletion of the 7th floor group post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/7th_Floor_Group). Their reasons are lack of credible information, which is quite valid in this case -- not to see they're might not be underlying truth -- but that they as a site looking to weed out false information will not accept things without concrete documented citations. 

If we want to improve information, we need to be rigorous with ourselves as well as others. Don't assume everything is against you and look a little deeper, because there is plenty of legitimate shit we need to uncover. 

TL;DR - Wikipedia has a very exhaustive and documented thread for why they delete each post. Don't treat them as a boogeyman just because they didn't find a article to be well substantiated enough to make the site, that's their job.

323,"War. Tides Upon Us All. Where is this war? Shucks, it's on the Internet &amp; more...","Wonderful to see the discussions on r/conspiracy as the lines are being drawn in the sand and the fact that this is indeed a war against or for: opinions and history.

For starters, everyone who is the public and is not angry should take use of the forums resources. If you're serious about being on the front-lines of fighting this opinion war, of which is civil war, people are really being murdered and these shootings correlate between all of it.

Remember during 9/11 when the media played and played over again the towers crashing for months?

Okay, so when the Las Vegas shooting happens and the FBI take away public witness cellphones, laptops, etc. and don't release the shooting images as it was.. the legitimate news is that it's being covered up, isn't it strange that we don't get to see the footage?

There is footage to show that some people weren't even scared of the bullets, and the question is whether some of the crowd was trained to run after they heard fireworks. 

Before the fireworks a Hispanic woman grabbed another, shaking her, ""Your all going to die!"" and the police escort the female Hispanic away.

Fireworks were set off a handful of seconds before gunfire. Witness Kym Suchomel was very vocal of the sequence of events on Facebook. 

People really died and in the end some media sources along with LVPD claim they don't want to release the footage out of respect for the victims families… the other reason to cover-up multi-shootings is because even LV locals don't want public to think LV is dangerous… 

On top of this LV list, conspiracy theorists must contend with fake conspiracy theorists who are allowed mainstream coverage in which they tout their disgusting ideas about how the victims didn't even die (but people did die and smart theorists know that people died and those who question the death are the same types who question Obama's birth certificate).

Full circle now. Those conspiracies about Obama's birth, those conspiracy theorists were a part of the agenda of muddying the label of an opinionated free-thinking citizen. A blow to the world of theory, lies have been used to confuse those who choose not to believe everything they are shown, and even liberals were twisted into disliking 'conspiracy theorists.'

The media is a platter and everyone's platter is tailored. 

Here's an example of how conspiracy theorists are being portrayed, on PBS https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/witness-charlottesville-death-threats-conspiracy-theories-began

yet smart theorists know that these angry theorists with stupid ideas are getting coverage because it's part of the agenda to make conspiracy theorist look like vile spineless creatures.

Kym Suchomel, died in her bed of a seizure after wanting to gather victims to relay their own story.  Her family took down her account because they're tired of people claiming Suchomel could have been murdered.

https://heavy.com/news/2017/10/kymberley-suchomel-las-vegas-shooting-facebook/comment-page-0/

 I'm sure the Suchomel family doesn't want to talk to anyone about it ever again. What's happening with Kym's friends? That's what I'd like to know…

The lawyer, Orville Almon, representing the country singer Jason Aldean also died in his bed of seizures. I tried to find a Nashville news link but could not. The lawyer is dead regardless, just as is investigative journalists and -ism:

Above you can dig and begin to find that this war goes straight to every type of healthy lifestyle and practice that is harder to capitalize on... When people are healthy they don't need pharmaceuticals. When people are happy they don't need a new _____ anything. 

Why break what isn't broken? Because if you didn't buy another _____, then the rich man would be a little less richer.

Simple deductions here. No link for common knowledge, sense tells us: history tends to repeat itself, especially when psychotics are driving the bus. A government who's admittedly experimented and succeeded at brainwash would probably try again and again. 

Rinse. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

This is a war against truth and control.

Here's a small example of how FBI can scout out an unstable person in an attempt to create a terrorist: http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/psychological-operations/parents-catch-fbi-plot-force-mentally-ill-son-right-wing-terrorist/

I do believe books have already been written about how terrorists can be created, but I have yet to dive into that topic of the library yet. 

Rabbit-holes include rabbits. 


ELSAGATE:

Be careful with this everyone. Elsagate, pizzagate, pingpongs. Fantasyland. 
For those who don't yet know ""Fantasyland"" is reference to Disneyland. 

I've been reading the book ""Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency"" by James Bamford, and recommend it an excellent resource, perhaps a bible to this new world metronome, as it's essentially the skeleton keys to our nations underbelly. Award winning: http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/29/reviews/010429.29findert.html

I discovered the NSA sends all it's top-secret recyclable documents to Florida's Disney World (Fantastyland) on pg. 516[paperbck] ""Body of Secrets"" it reads:

""They transport the huge heaps of ""burn bags"" crammed with discarded secrets, NSA turned, appropriately enough, to Disneyworld. In Fantasyland... the 61 1/2 foot-wide conveyor belt dumps the bags into a giant blenderlike vat that... breaks it into pulp... within a few weeks, the documents that once held the nation's most precious secrets hold ... pizzas. In 1998, the agency took in $58,953 in profit from the sale of its declassified pizza boxes."" -- J. Bamford

When I read that, I was floored. And now to see this Q making lists with 'Fantasyland' clicked a puzzle piece together for me..

So NSA makes pizza boxes out of the paper, and the give the bags of paper to Disneyworld. Okay, it's a fact. Notice I'm not giving an opinion yet. It's because it's a funny coincidence. 

Q asked ""do you believe in coincidences?""

Well, my Question to you: do you believe in the addiction of using coincidences as a murderers signature? 


Let's change subject b/c shits hit the fan and this is a war. Still Disney related, and from a health news link that I'm sure would make an angry person angrier and a normal person questioning:

http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/03/25/disneys-ducktales-exposed-ask-about-illuminati/

It's all coming together here and now. 

Are you still here?

Freedom is at stake and with this, symbols are a tool. Pizza and ping-pongs are meant to keep us distracted from the truth and are indeed planted into entertainment pre-pizzagate exposure. Just stop watching those stupid movies and read.

Further, there is an agenda in place to cause racist theorists to focus on religious cultures, specifically the Jewish culture as a whole, in a scapegoated lie in order to keep covered up the fact that a pedophiles a pedophile regardless of their historical heritage. 

Fact that a large portion of Jewish people spurred the pornography industry, even though true, is another resource to blanket a lie to try and pawn the racist-card on conspiracy theorists. This reminds me of the old new news that the FBI used Charles Manson to turn the public against the image of the hippie.

Same idea. Rinse, repeat. Different label. Go.

Simply, pizza and ping-pongs were planned for conspiracy theorists to devour all their energy and time into finding symbols planted. It's a rabbit hole of confusion. Just another distracting lie.

This is how it works: lie. Once a lie is made the lie has to continue. The thread of lies has gotten so long, these murdering child-rapists thought they'd win because they print money and own everything. What they don't own is your opinion and that is what they fear.

Know what the enemy fears. 

Below is my personal theory: 

The fight for censorship is upon us as Elsagate comes forward in the the mainstream, what will happen next is mass censorship as parents become increasingly horrified and soon to take to the streets when the winter ends; I'm sure protests will happen soon

This will bring about policies filled with censorship regulations. Policies that will be written by the ones who are still trafficking people.

Imagine a censored world where a trafficked person can neither escape or report they are being taken. Local authorities, social service facilities, and police bend to the will of this rich elite group because they are alpha-badges, what Q calls 'Clowns In America' ahem. Simple A here, CIA. Clowns they are, Q is correct.

Q is further correct to say most Americans cannot handle the entire truth at once. Many people will simply commit suicide. Please don't. 

Stay strong. Stay smart. 


Q: Elsagate aftermath - what will be censored? 
A: Truth and the label of 'conspiracy' 

This is why it's very important that we stay on key with word choice, emotion, citation. Conspiracy has nothing to do with tin-foil and crystals, that's metaphysics. Conspiracies were meant to stop murderers and intricate plots of government attempting to silence truth.


Remember, arguing with a stranger who reverts to anger is the immediate point in which the conversation ends and the truth is revealed. Anger does nothing but cause your intelligent comment to be buried. 

Learn the tactics and know that your energy should be spent digging for truth and not arguing with strangers. 

Q's lists are easier to read…. but I'm not here to do anything but keep pushing while the murderers keep trying to cover the tracks.

Next up:

Links are dead!

What to do:

Screenshot after you read the ones you feel legit. 
Chances are they are soon to be erased. 

These lessons are being brought to you by a person of failed experience. Who knows when I shall set another puzzle theory in motion. 

Instead of hiding and making a new reedit account, I remain Oldmoldy and a couple other accounts to perhaps be revealed if I ever finish the book to reveal the rest of the rabbithole Q is currently working on.

it's like chapter puzzle pieces. you guys get it right?
he's giving us puzzle pieces without the opinion.

What im proposing is this:

Some sort of Anti-gravitic technology does exist.  If you look into different branches of physics, technology, etc...its almost as if all the missing pieces for futuristic technology have been shattered, and spread throughout each scientific discipline, making it impossible for one person who masters in a single field of study, to be able to connect the dots when it comes to these certain requirements.

We know that back in the early 1900's that Tesla was onto something, and his funding eventually was snuffed, all his blue-prints, and inventions seized, etc, etc.

So, in terms of physics, and magnetism/electromagnetism, there seems to be some sort of drop off.  There is a guy named Eric P. Dollard who claims that Maxwells Equations were not finished, as well as other pioneers in electricity who came up with governing equations had the same issue--they simply did not finish their research, and therefore we have an incomplete understanding of electricity and magnetism.

Everything we have built our society upon today relies upon the physics of Newton and Einstein, and our electrical infrastructure has not changed much in the past 100 years.  People dont challenge the status quo because--well--look how far we've come...theres no way we could be wrong about anything, or need to refine our predecessors work...right!!??

I just cant help but think there is a missing link between standard physics and electricity that evades us, and is holding us back.  Tesla knew stuff that we dont, we at least know that much, and he was far ahead of his time in terms of understanding electricity.

Would it be strange to think that TPTB helped to move along progress with these classical mechanics, leading to our dependancy on oil, all the while building an infrastructure that teaches us only to use these classical mechanics to further perpetuate our enslavement to things like gasoline, and oil...?

I was on a science subreddit, and mentioned Electric Univers and Plasma Cosmology, and this guy completely went into retard mode--acted as if every word i typed was wrong before he even read it or tried to comprehend it.  He went and posted articles from years ago that try to debunk the theory, yet the theory itself has made incredible progress in the past 3 years, and continues to refine the theory at every turn.  No doubt in 10 years when they have the math figured out, and many, many observations matching hypotheses, it will be a solid contender in mainstream academia...but right now?  People are programmed to shit on anything they disagree with.  Its like the shit with the church and the scientists never happened way back when, when they were hanging people who said the earth went around the sun, or that the world was not flat--all which turned out to be true.  

Getting kindof off topic here though.  Basically, what i can say is this:  If it were discovered that nuclear fusion does not take place in the sun, but that its something else...something electrical in nature--that would shatter the foundations upon which physics is built, the foundation upon which every working piece of equipment and technology we currently use is built, so it cannot be admitted there could be another way to achieve the same result, due to the implications that could have on other facets of technology and physics.  That would open the door for things like anti-gravity, quantum teleportation, etc etc...all these crazy things we think are impossible--we would then know we've been lied to, and that the technology exists.

349,"Gender pronouns. Watched some Jordan Peterson stuff, pretty firery. But how would you and even could you, legislate this nonsense, where if you fail to identify others your ass gets hauled in court?","It's all nonsense of course. They say it is about respect but the professor promptly cuts them down to size by saying respect is earned through individualism and physical achievement. 

But here is what gets me, there are classifications such as 'gender fluid', where maybe some are male in the morning, binary in the afternoon, and female in the evening. So does that mean I need to give seperate pronouns three times a day, for one person? If so, what happens when, for the same person, who has the same face, reverses the gender roles to the last gender, and then you call them by the wrong gender? 

What if I decided to be a gender fluid person, change my gender every 5 mins and troll the fuck out of people for mislabelling me, and jail whoever I want when I want and how I want?

389,Do you think Russia dossier author Christopher Steele is credible?,"&gt;Steele was recruited by MI6 directly following his graduation from Cambridge, working in London at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) from 1987 to 1989.[1] From 1990 to 1992, **Steele worked under diplomatic cover as an MI6 agent in Moscow, serving at the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow.[8][11] Steele was an “internal traveller”, visiting newly-accessible cities such as Samara and Kazan.[5]**
&gt;
Steele's identity as an MI6 officer was one of 115 names Her Majesty's Government attempted to suppress through a DSMA-Notice in 1999.[12][13] He returned to London in 1993, working again at the FCO until his posting to Paris in 1998, where he served under diplomatic cover until 2002.[11][14][15][16] In 2003, Steele was sent to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan as part of an MI6 team, briefing Special Forces on ""kill or capture"" missions for Taliban targets, and also spent time teaching new MI6 recruits.[11] **By 2006, Steele was heading the Russia Desk at MI6**.[5][8][17]
&gt;
**Steele's expertise on Russia remained valued, and he served as a senior officer under John Scarlett, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), from 2004 to 2009.[17] Steele was selected as case officer for Alexander Litvinenko and participated in the investigation of the Litvinenko poisoning in 2006.[11] It was Steele who quickly realised that Litvinenko's death ""was a Russian state 'hit'"".[17]**
&gt;
In March 2009, Steele with his fellow MI6-retiree Chris Burrows co-founded the private intelligence agency Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., based in Grosvenor Square Gardens near Buckingham Palace.[18][8] **Between 2014 and 2016 Steele created over 100 reports on Russian and Ukrainian issues, which were read within the United States Department of State, and he was viewed as credible by the United States intelligence community.**[5]

In 2017 Steele established a new company called Chawton Holdings, again with Christopher Burrows.[19]

37,Simple question about the JFK files,"I believe in the 1960s the CIA was supposed to be a foreign intelligence service only.  
If Oswald really is the lone shooter with no help from a foreign power; why are they involved at all?   
Why would those files be in their possession and made classified for 50 years due to national security reasons? 

Are the files of other obvious lone shooter assassinations (or attempted ones like on Reagan) kept in the dark?

77,Why would Jesus Campos drive to Mexico right after the shooting? I think it's obvious.,"Why would Campos hop in a rental car and head to Mexico? Because he was taking a big suitcase full of cash to his family.

MGM sat him down and said ""Look, we know this is a big payday for you. We know you can make the rounds on the talk shows and news channels and rake in a ton of cash. Rather than have you do that, and open up a can of worms and potential liability for MGM, why don't we just pay you. We'll set up one interview with a MGM-friendly host, Ellen, who will recount our version of events. All you have to do is nod. In exchange for this being your ONLY interview, we will pay you a large cash sum. Take it to Mexico and give your family a good life.""

It's not hard for a casino to come up with a large amount of basically untraceable cash, so they do. So, Campos throws the suitcase full of cash in a car (because you can't fly with that much money undetected) and heads across the border. Cars are rarely checked on their way down, just the way back. The money is staying in Mexico so there's no problem there.

""Morning y'all!!! It SURE IS shaping up to be another GREAT day, isn't it?!

Rarely do I feel the need to point out my own credibility so I'll just remind you that this was filed independently yesterday, on behalf of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. as the DEFENDANT. Note, it wasn't filed by the DOJ or on behalf of an individual.

Now as yourselves this... why would this FACT, be important? Why would Donald J. Trump for President, INC. want to legally file this? What protections are afforded from the day organizations like ""Wikileaks.org"" are named/implicated, in a formally filed US District Supreme Court?

Hypothetically and all... if you were in the position of releasing valuable, leaked information you've obtained to the public, you'd probably want to first ensure the ball you PRE-NEGOTIATED federal protections on, was legally rolling, right? If you had secretly negotiated your terms with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher back in August and had agreed you'd keep a lid on your shit until the negotiated deadline of 10/21/17, then you'd also need to wait for the parties/campaign INC's you negotiated with, to legally file action in favor of your protection, no?!

Except here's the thing, as soon as you file ANYTHING with a federal US District Court, it BECOMES and is ADDED to accessible, PUBLIC RECORDS, isn't it?!

So, if you're trying to keep shit under wraps until you're ready to pull a trigger, you'd probably wait to file what will become a matter of public record, until you absolutely have to do it, right?!

Y'all let paid /pol/trolls turn me into some ""10/21 Assange release happening"", that I NEVER CLAIMED would actually happen, on the 21st. Instead of reading my well-documented, archived posts thoroughly and IN FULL for yourselves, y'all chose to become the LARP's you claim you know better than to fall for... ""

The police know, of course they know. Clearly something is stopping them from acting. If a private investigation finds and releases hard evidence of the assaults, their hands will be forced and Hollywood will become a much safer place.

If Corey starts recklessly naming high profile figures without that hard evidence, he'll be sued into poverty and mocked into obscurity like everyone who tried before him. Just look at what happened when the BBC was protecting Savville.

If he doesn't name people until after he has the evidence, nobody can sue him for liable and he can't be mocked because of naming such ridiculous people.

Remember how people reacted to Cosby's acusers? 

""The black sweater guy? Yeah right!""

Or Savville again

""The guy from Jim'll fix it? As if he'd be a pedophile!""

These people have complete control over public perception. Hollywood doesn't just make movies. Many of the big corporation owners also own news corporations. If they want you to disregard anything someone says, for instance, making you think Corey Feldman is an attention-seeking nutjob, they'll make you think they're laughable.

This has happened time and time again to people who name names. Corey is trying to force the police into action by publicising real evidence. Why does it have to be public? 

For some reason, evidence of this ring seems to disappear when the police get hold of it. One former child actor gave an actual list of people who had raped her straight to a judge (again, not publicly accusing to avoid liable) and guess what happened. The police ""lost"" it.

&gt;*All it took to land a Palestinian construction worker in police custody for several hours on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack last week was a Facebook post — and a message mistranslated by a machine.*

&gt;*The construction worker...posted a photo of himself leaning nonchalantly against a bulldozer near the West Bank settlement of Beitar Illit, near Jerusalem. In his left hand, he balanced a cup of coffee and a lit cigarette. Underneath the photo were Arabic words that roughly translate to “good morning.”*

&gt;*But a Facebook algorithm used to translate one language to another converted the words to something very different. In Hebrew, the algorithm translated the message to “attack them.” In English, “hurt them.”*

**The article points out that the US government is openly collecting social media data on ""...permanent U.S. residents and naturalized citizens — since 2012, a program that was expanded in 2015.""**

&gt;*A new federal rule that took effect last week may lead to an increase in both scope and frequency of this data collection, lawyers said. It also revealed for the first time that the government intends to store that information indefinitely.*

three four two one four three

I subscribed to the second incarnation of the channel along with a handful of other people, maybe 23 of us total. After a series of 18 or so ominous videos, a final video appeared with a simple message that went something like this:

The channel and all of its videos were then deleted without a trace. Shortly there after, my life took a decidedly strange turn along similar lines as the character Dion in Robert Guffey's last book, Chameleo.

310,"Where did the Oswald double theory originate? A critical examination of the ""legend"" laid down for Oswald and the genesis of the meme of multiple Oswalds","Last night as I was drifting off to sleep I was listening to a [radio segment](https://youtu.be/QXuRfnxf2qc) from Black Op Radio with author [John Armstrong](http://harveyandlee.net/). Armstrong was laying out the evidence that he is collected that there were actually two Lee Harvey Oswalds. Armstrong has published a book on this subject called [""Harvey and Lee""](http://a.co/iXbcCGF). The title of the book is derived from Armstrong's delineation of the two Oswald identities where he calls one Oswald ""Harvey"" and the other ""Lee"". Armstrong also theorizes that there were two Marguerite Oswalds, Lee Harvey Oswald's mother, one of them tall and attractive and the other short and ""dumpy""-looking; the latter being the Marguerite that surfaced in the aftermath of JFK's assassination. 

There are critiques of ""Harvey and Lee"" [online](http://22november1963.org.uk/john-armstrong-harvey-and-lee-theory) that do a reasonable job of debunking Armstrong's book but I have some reservations about the evidence that debunkers cite to knock down the two Oswald theory. From the critique linked above from 22november1963.org.uk (bold emphasis mine):

&gt; Michael Eddowes’s The Oswald File, published in 1977, put forward an altogether more outlandish theory, claiming that the Oswald who returned to the US from the Soviet Union in 1962 was an impostor who went on to shoot President Kennedy on behalf of the Soviet regime. It was as a result of pressure from Eddowes that **Oswald’s body was exhumed in 1981. Unsurprisingly, the body in the grave turned out to be that of the actual, American–born Oswald who had defected in 1959.**

One of the first pieces of evidence always marshaled against the Oswald double theory is this exhumation and autopsy in 1981. As we learn from the [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/05/us/oswald-s-body-is-exhumed-an-autopsy-affirms-identity.html) on the exhumation on October 5th, 1981, the autopsy confirmed Oswald's identity via dental records and a scar from childhood [mastoid surgery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnonLwxW2Cg). There has been significant controversy about this positive identification and this was abetted by Paul Groody, the man who embalmed Oswald, saying that there were indications that Oswald's body had been tampered with when he viewed it after the '81 exhumation. For further critical analysis of Groody's claims I'd recommend reading these two papers: [The Exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswald and the Norton Report](http://jfkassassination.net/parnell/lhox2.htm#_edn3) and [Grave Doubts: A Report on the Exhumation and Autopsy of 
the Remains of Lee Harvey Oswald](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/lhoexh.txt). Regardless of who is buried in Oswald's grave, the door to doubt was opened because the burial vault Oswald was entombed in was damaged and partially open when exhumed in '81 and because DNA tests have never been done on the corpse.

**Richard Popkin's ""The Second Oswald""**

The origin of the two Oswald theory in the public consciousness likely can be attributed in part to Richard Popkin's 1966 book [""The Second Oswald""](http://a.co/aQJ7rxG) which is much more broadly focused than Armonstrong's ""Harvey and Lee"" in that it examines a number of areas of evidence against Oswald critically like whether he shot Tippit and whether he would've had enough time to fire the bullets that killed JFK and wounded Governor Connally. Mixed in with this analysis is the hypothesis that there could've been an Oswald double in Dallas on 11/22/63 so the book takes a much more limited view of the Oswald double theory in comparison with Armstrong's work which seems to suggest that ""Harvey"" and ""Lee"" Oswald were part of an intelligence operation that had been set up from the time both boys were around 12 years old or even earlier than that and the double of Oswald's identity was merged with the ""real"" Oswald.

**Don DeLillo, from [""Libra""](http://a.co/4eLQvMN ), a 1988 fictional account of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald commenting on the nature of theories in the JFK assassination:**

&gt; Six point nine seconds of heat and light. Let's call a meeting to analyze the blur. Let's devote our lives to understanding this moment, separating the elements of each crowded second. We will build theories that gleam like jade idols, intriguing systems of assumption, four-faced, graceful. ... There is much here that is holy, an aberration in the heartland of the real. Let's regain our grip on things.

**The genesis of the Oswald double hypothesis**

I think that the real genesis for all these theories that there was a second or multiple Oswalds is that the intelligence agencies manipulated the data given to the public on Oswald to such an extend that it was inevitable for there to be confusion and wild speculation. A good example of the duplicitousness of these agencies can be seen in a glance at the [photo](http://harveyandlee.net/4LHO/Mex%20Sov.jpg) that the CIA provided that is supposed to depict Oswald in Mexico. 

My own conclusion is that Oswald was sheep-dipped as is well-established in this [Corbett Report piece](https://youtu.be/IWsAoWqc52w). There was also a legend laid down in the run-up to the assassination, not unlike the legend laid down for the hijackers in the 9/11 like [Mohammed Atta asking about crop dusters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100612269610000000) or any number of other very odd and most importantly memorable incidents that fixed the hijackers in the minds of pre-9/11 witnesses, the same was true for Oswald. 

The ""legend"" of Oswald include instances where Oswald was [shooting](https://youtu.be/QmGhmWaY_0c) conspicuously at a [rifle range](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/wood_h.htm) using a rifle that had a loud report and had a ""ball of fire coming out at the end of the barrel"" when fired. 

Other aspects of the Oswald legend are well-chronicled in James Douglass' [""JFK and the Unspeakable""](http://a.co/8MUufuO) including the story of [Ralph Yates](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/Unspeakable/TwoLHOs.html) who picked up a hitchhiker on 11/20/63 with a brown package that the hitchhiker said was curtain rods. The hitchhiker, who Yates identified as Oswald after the assassination, then had this remarkable exchange as described by Yates before asking to be dropped off at Houston Street right near the book depository:

&gt; Yates stated the man then asked Yates if he thought a person could assassinate the President. Yates replied that he guessed such a thing could be possible. The man then asked Yates if it could be done from the top of a building or out of a window, high up, and Yates said he guessed this was possible if one had a good rifle with a scope and was a good shot.

&gt; Yates advised about this time the man pulled out a picture which showed a man with a rifle and asked Yates if he thought the President could be killed with a gun like that one. Yates said he was driving and did not look at the picture but indicated to the man that he guessed so.

&gt; Yates said that the man then asked if he knew the President’s route for the parade in Dallas and Yates replied that he did not know the route but that it had been in the paper. He said the man then said that he had misunderstood him and that actually he had asked Yates if he thought that the President would change his route. Yates said he replied that he doubted it unless they might for safety reasons

**Coda and Peter Dale Scott**

It is also worth noting that authors like Peter Dale Scott have written at considerable length about the CIA manipulations of the Oswald file and the laying down of the Oswald ""legend"". [The Three Oswald Deceptions: The Operation, The Cover-up and the Conspiracy](http://www.assassinationweb.com/scottd.htm) and [CIA Files and the Pre-Assassination Framing of Lee Harvey Oswald](http://www.assassinationweb.com/scottc.htm), both of which were originally published in Scott's [Deep Politics II](http://a.co/1u1C5L8), detail the manipulation of Oswald's intelligence files before they were seen by the Warrant Commission. A brief excerpt of CIA Files and the Pre-Assassination Framing of Lee Harvey Oswald summarizes the manipulations:

&gt; More serious is the evidence that the CIA files were being fed false information from without, while in the same period CIA officers were further distorting and falsifying the Oswald file with additional false information from inside, both prior to the assassination and subsequent to it. The cover-up in this area can presumably be taken as an indication of some important issue at stake.

&gt; With the new releases, the number of unanswered questions about ""Lee Oswald"" the file subject is now greater, not less, than before. However one hypothesis at the center seems more and more reasonable. This is that the CIA's files were being both fed and doctored in late 1963 to present a continuous flow of apparent evidence, always plausible but never conclusive, and above all never true, that Oswald was a possible agent of Soviet or Cuban intelligence. 

So the true origin of the Oswald double brings us full circle with the finger pointing squarely at the intelligence agencies and specifically the CIA. I think it is helpful to keep this in mind as we absorb new information that might be trickling out of the JFK assassination archives. Remember that this is a hall of mirrors and always look for additional sources. ",conspiracy,1509061281,murderalaska,0,9,True,2017-10-26

343,James Alefantis is in the Cult of the Elephantine Triad,"The Ancient Egyptians learned, early on, that they could co-opt other gods and assign them under the pharoah's sway. 

In Aswan, red granite obelisks were constructed and Eratosthenes was able to travel to Aswan because of its ideal latitude and accurately measure the circumference of the earth by using the shadows of an obelisk.

Aswan, until the modern era, was the only place to obtain red granite for the construction of obelisks.

One such Obelisk was erected in Alexandria and stood for ages until Augustus took it and moved it to the necropolis in Rome on the site that would become the Circus of Nero, where a vortex of publicly accepted human sacrifices occurred in a chariot track. That is where the Vatican stands, today.

That obelisk was covered in the 1400s to shave off the hieroglyphics, but still stands in St Peter's square, today.

The Elephantine Triad is the ram headed god, Khnum, his wife and their divine child, Anqet.

The Vatican, in Paul the 6th's audience hall, inside of a giant snake head, has a monument to the ram-headed god in plain sight.

The myth of the Triad was conformed to have more mass appeal to attain more wealth and power. This cycle of converting the myth has continued for ages and the cult members and religious members are merely tools/sheep/donation cows to the leaders.

344,"Just So Its Clear: It Wasn't And Isn't Just ""The CIA""","The CIA is real and it exists on paper, but if you really want to see what the CIA is, its first necessary to imagine a world without boarders.  There is a world without boarders already, YOU just aren't a part of it.  The ""CIA"" is just what Americans call that visible part of something that Americans know shouldn't exist.

A government that explicitly isn't ""of the people"" or ""for the people"".  

Its a ruling class, a separate class of people that isn't necessarily defined by money.  Sure money comes with it, its definitely part of the birthright. Put another way, everyone with the birthright has plenty of money but NOT everyone with plenty of money has the birthright.

So the CIA is just part of our government that was carved out by these people (hijacked from ""the people"") where the constitution and every other law of the land can be fully ignored.  Where inductees are selected by internally prescribed methods (the easiest kind of methods to hijack) and ""The People"" have absolutely no representation within these secretive organizations.

You see the problem yet?

Its not the CIA its a group that's much bigger, the CIA is officially a supernational organization that not only has effective control of the American intelligence complex, but many other similar organizations from many other nation states.

If the USA were to sink into the ocean tomorrow, the ""CIA"" would only lose a small fraction of its total assets.  It is a foreign and a domestic organization at the same time.  Its super-national and thus its not American.

If you want to have any chance of ""making america great again"". The very first thing you should do is get rid of the CIA.

Come in with docs they know will never see the light of day and scare him shitless. Such a meeting is said to have happened to Jimmy Carter, causing him to back off UFO disclosure.

Maybe they like the mystique, knowing that no ""reasonable"" person, nor society at large will ever take seriously the idea of a government agency working against the citizens... so they run these charades just to rile up those that believe, spread disinfo, and foster a general terror of opposing them.

Maybe this is a perfect recruiting opportunity to test new censoring agents and test their loyalty. Maybe the press around this will divert scrutiny from other ""hiding in plain sight"" operations.

Maybe they waited till the last minute on these select documents in order to tailor what they do reveal to our current political climate. Designing a ""gotcha"" revelation that leaves some of their departments open to some blame but remains a red herring compared to what really went down. Perhaps there were several red herrings available in the documents, but they waited till now to pick the perfect one to gain advantage in this specific political climate.

360,Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatus: Major differences between Adolf Hitler and Alexander Adolf Hitler,"#Major differences between Adolf Hitler and Alexander Adolf Hitler 

**Introduction**  
Hitler was TIME Magazine's Man Of The Year in 1938: the German people assumed they were safe from a tyrant, the World assumed that they were safe from the New World Order, alias Global Slavery.

What was once only partly a mockery is now nothing but a mockery, with two fake identities both playing suicide bombers as TIME Magazine's Man Of The Year 2012 and 2013, Obama and Bergoglio.  
The same type of mockery as to have Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman playing fake identity UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan AND ... impersonating Nelson Mandela since 1989.  
And that illustrates the third difference of the list:

**Major differences between Adolf Hitler and Alexander Adolf Hitler**  

**1.** Alexander Adolf Hitler rules over a larger empire than Adolf Hitler ever did.  
In fact Alexander Adolf Hitler is the most powerful mortal in the History of Mankind.  
Independently from the fact that the real III Reich also included Stalin fake ""allies"", the USA and the UK, it didn't include the Soviet Union.  
Since 2010 Alexander Adolf Hitler rules also over Russia, after the real Putin and his family were murdered and replaced by impostors.

**2.** Everyone knew about Adolf Hitler, the most widely man of his time.  
In fact Adolf Hitler is one of the four most widely known men in History, together with Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad.  
Virtually nobody knows about Alexander Adolf Hitler, not to mention about his power.  
Never before in History were so few people aware of who the most powerful man on Earth is.  

**3.** Adolf Hitler was not a bad actor, but his performance was very much restricted to inflammatory speeches.  
Alexander Adolf Hitler is one of the most talented actors ever.  
No wonder that theater is one of his passions, if not THE passion.

**4.** There is no doubt whatsoever that Alexander Adolf Hitler is the current supreme leader of the illuminati, the reason that makes him the most powerful mortal ever.  
Adolf Hitler at some point the illuminati supreme leader remains only a possibility.  

**5.** Alexander Adolf Hitler, unlike Adolf Hitler, has two cousins listed as the two most powerful women on Earth.  
Same difference in other words: Adolf Hitler, unlike Alexander Adolf Hitler, has two daughters listed as the two most powerful women on the planet.  
More precisely the fake identities Hillary Rodham alias Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel.  
This accordingly to the Forbes magazine that also publishes the most cited list of the world's richest.

**BASICS**  
Patrick Stewart (real name: Alexander Adolf Hitler, oldest son of William Patrick Stewart Hitler): Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatus, the man who released not only the script for actor playing ""billionaire Trump"" but also for EVERYONE else in world politics.

At least 192 of the heads of the UN states do nothing but to execute orders from him.

**Introduction**  
Although almost everything that illuminati do is criminal according to their own legal system, ANY criminal activities of illuminati members are never accidentally leaked, from corruption to robbing billions, from rapes to murders.  
""WikiLeaks"" is an illuminati joke about ""All 'leaks' are staged"", with a CIA agent playing the fake identity ""Julian Assange"" in the role of ""Master of Fake Leaks"".  
""WikiLeaks"" is also used to advance the terror agenda, to terrorize any potential TRUE leakers.

**Leaks ALWAYS staged, from pedoLeaks to ""Whistleblower: government is spying on you"" and ""caught on live TV""**  
All ""NSA whistleblowers"", from Julian ACIAnge to SNOWden: nothing but actors using fake identities, all staged to advance illuminati agendas.   
Such leaks range from nothing but lies to almost all true.

**Fulfilling the illuminati religion's third commandment ""Black is White""**  
Leaks passing truth in plain sight are in fact staged to advance the agendas behind what they are supposedly ""exposing"":  
- from pedoleaks such as Vatileaks, Dutch pedo minister rapes Turkish kids and BBC Saville's a pedophile for many decades, used to in fact advance the ""legalize pedophilia"" agenda;  
- to ""Whistleblower: government is spying on you"", where ""coincidentally"" one of the main agendas advanced is: 'Be happy that you are being spied on'.

**BASICS**  
Mass media is totally controlled by the illuminati.

Now, the various ""mainstream"" news sources are reporting that there will be ""counterprotests"" as well. The ironic part is, the ""counterprotesters"" are never given a name, unlike the local news calling the group who has the speaking permit ""white nationalists"" ""Nazis"" and ""White Lives Matter"" repeatedly. 

 The comments left on the Facebook page of the area's most popular news channel, News Channel 5, are heavily in favor of the counterprotests. This same news channel has been pushing at least this all week. A ""large amount of counterprotesters"" is expected. ([Source](http://www.newschannel5.com/news/large-amount-of-counter-protesters-expected-for-white-lives-matter-rally)). 
Murfreesboro, TN mayor McFarland spoke out against the WLM protest on Facebook this week first in a [post](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/10/26/murfreesboro-mayors-statement-condemns-ideology-white-lives-matter-rally/802339001/) then in a [video](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/10/23/mayors-wearemurfreesboro-video-denounces-white-lives-matter-rally/790103001/). The anti-white lives citizens have even created a clever hashtag.

Now, this all may seem quite strange or tame. Consider: Shelbyville's only claim to fame is that the town has seemingly been [taken over by Muslims.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQFcWGgPigE) TN is a historically red state, but at least two major cities heavily supported Hilary in the last election, and the vote was so close that the tension in the air here was palpable. TN has some of the highest addiction and prescription rates in the state and Trump has declared an ""opioid crisis"" here. As for Murfreesboro,  the violent crime rate is one of the highest in the nation, and its reputation in Middle Tennessee is infamous ([Source](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/tn/murfreesboro/crime)).

Last night, these two photos I found from locals circulating on Facebook:

The wording of this ad is strange and leads me to believe its authenticity; however, the ""non-globalist soverign mindset"" line does make me think this may be a joke or spoof. 

Enough links. What do you all think? I was surprised when I was scrolling through the sub and didn't see anything here about this. Like WV, the state of TN is oft forgotten about and rarely ever present in the national media. The lack of media attention here simply makes it even easier to conduct some shady ass shit, IMO. MTSU is the heart and center of Murfreesboro, and school is currently in session. Tennessee is also the home of the KKK. I have actually been here many years and never met a member of the KKK or anyone supporting them. While I am sure inherent racism will continue to exist due to the nature of humanity in general, I have never been the witness to overt AA racism here. In fact, most comments on social media from residents regarding this event are in support of minorities.

While nothing has happened yet, I have been on this sub for several years and so my mind wanders, especially when presented with photos and stories meant to shape public and personal opinion quite intentionally. ",conspiracy,1509068448,high-valyrian,1,7,True,2017-10-26

423,Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory: Secret Societies Do Drugs,"So here's my big unified conspiracy theory.
TL;DR: drugs create loyalty bonds, and these explain how secret societies function, and what their ""secret"" is (it's drugs).

In ancient times secret societies arose, mystery cults that is, around the use of drugs.

Drugs do two things: create psychedelic experiences, hack the dopamine system.

I won't dig into the psychedelic stuff yet, because that can invoke religion (not mysticism, but theology; that is, nothing supernatural, just basic questions about consciousness, where for the purposes of this post I'm leaving aside any supernatural conclusions).

The thing about drugs and dopamine is this: they hack your brain.  The dopamine system is a balanced system meant to help regulate your choice and sense of purpose in life.  It helps you balance out family, nourishment, social life, accomplishment.  Drugs jack into it, and your life starts to orient around getting the drug.  Even if you defend, like, THC use, then at least think about the danger of opiods and how hardcore they are.  The point is this: there's an emotional connection involved.

I'm not here to make a moral critique.  Drugs create, through dopamine triggering, an emotional bond between a person and the drug.  See the culture of marijuana, for example.

So, if you had a secret society that ritualistically combine drug use with ritual and social structure, you could create a powerful loyalty order.

This is the key element of my whole theory.  What drives someone to spurn family, morality, religion, integrity, etc?  How can a secret society exist?  Aren't (excepting the minority of people who are sociopathic) most people good and truthful?  How could a secret order endure?  

For a secret order to capture a large societal bureaucracy, you'd need the consistently good and noble people who public run the system to bend their will when ordered to the secret society.  What's the mechanism to accomplish that?

Drugs.

You create a powerful emotional connection between a person and the order.

Addiction is a crude way of doing this, and more obvious, and with addiction the loyalty is to the substance, not the order per se.

But, let's say the rumors about Masons are true and they use Acacia plant (and maybe also local fungi) to have psychedelic experiences in the context of their most secret ceremonies.  The use of psychedelics is ""their big secret"".

If you are initiated to drug use via mumbo-jumbo images and symbols which will contextualize the psychedelic experience, then that's the magic of the society.  You have a powerful emotional and personally meaningful ego-transcendent experience, which rewires the brain.

First of all, the initiate would come to conclude, perhaps, that they'd had a genuine epiphany.  Even some hardened circuit court judge who's a stuffy bean-counter or whatever could come around to accept the ""higher truth"" if having passed through a contextualized psychedelic experience.  The rest of their life and spiritual journey would have no meaningful anchor to provide an alternative context.  They'd go on being a circuit court judge, but secretly loyal to their private magical experience.

The second thing to happen is that whatever comes out of the experience emotionally, it bonds someone to the ""family"" which is the secret order.  There's the loyalty mechanism.

Let's call it a ""subtle addiction"" to a social structure which is hidden, and above and outside of the publicly known social structures like law or family.

My theory is that this brand of society has been in operation in dozens and dozens of different varieties for thousands of years. 

I wouldn't think they'd all be united in purpose, or command structure.  They'd do different things, maybe even have different drugs.  But, the use of psychedelic and dopamine altering substances to create social bonds is a common ""type"", I suspect, behind much of our hidden history.

SIDE NOTE: As for psychedelics, I think these provide access to mental archetypes.  I also think they attend massive dopamine releases.  The thing about dopamine is that it IS the brain's reward mechanism.  Every single happy, pleasurable, or good thing ends with biological mechanisms that end in a release of dopamine.  How or why dopamine works is a bigger question.

Regardless, I think psychedelics just mess up the mind.  Common experiences are related to, again, mental archetypes especially in the reptile brain.  But also: checkerboards, etc. that sort of thing.  What dopamine does is lay a veneer of ""OMG this is a good and happy vision"".  

So like, when you run a self test on your TV and it goes through all the colors and whatever, that's neither good nor bad, it's just running through its basic functions.  Jack that up with dopamine, and it's like: ""Oh my god the colors, it's the range of all experience, it's a transcendent whole""

That said, consciousness, and dopamine, and happiness, are still mysteries.  We don't know how that works and I suspect there might be something like ""God"" involved there.  But, I don't think the ""Freemasons"" have any kind of special knowledge about God.  Probably, they just have recorded common mental archetypes to contextualize psychedelic experience, and then when sober they further relate this to what was the pop-psychology of the nineteenth century.  So, it's nothing special.  What's special is the dopamine release and the social context.  Your ""brother"" provided that fine experience to you in their special ""way"".  That's the key to it all.

And, stuffy administrators - assholes whose lives orient around winning ""city precinct of the quarter"" awards - psychedelic experience is so above and beyond their moral and religious ambition that they'd have to be super easy to control.",conspiracy,1509069992,benedictFocker,8,0,True,2017-10-26

432,Illuminati Theater: Hollywood actors play Politicians - from Ted Danson to Danny DeVito,"#Hollywood actors play Politicians - Ted Danson to Danny Devito

**Introduction**  
Literally reversing the fake reality is the perfect form to let the curtain fall on the reversed Truman's show.

John Kerry and family, played by Hollywood actors Ted Danson and family, were the termination pioneers.  
No wonder that:  
- 'John Kerry', co-staring GW Bush, was also the termination pioneer in Politics 'alone', 2004: the first presidential candidates to openly tell to the cattle that they belonged to the same secret society.  
- comedian Danny DeVito starts playing Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, ""fracking the hell out of the USA"", first US minister of 100% Portuguese ancestry"", shortly before the official end of the show.

But one act goes beyond reversing Hollywood and Politics: it also reverse the actor's sex, in a parallel script to the First Lady ""Michelle Obama"".

**Hollywood ACTOR [ P &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; ] [ G &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; TT &amp;#95; ] plays Janet Napolitano - simulated reality terminated as its mockery, from Politics to Reality shows**  
As you might expect from this ultimate mockery for reversing the Politics show with Hollywood actors is also the only case where the illuminati openly tell the TRUTH to the cattle.  
Yet the human cattle desperately holds on to their seats, refusing to leave the room, because it perceives the TRUTH, not the simulated reality, as HELL.  
Once the riddle is solved it will become not only clear why Janet was named Napolitano but also what illuminati's most important film ever has to do with this particular actor.

450,"Simulated Reality: Why ""The Truman Show"" is the Most Important Illuminati Film Ever","#BIG BROTHER TV shows = SIMULATED REALITY = world as we know it 

**Introduction**  
The Truman World where the beasts live is the reversed 1998 film ""The Truman Show"" [1a], the SHOW to terminate ALL shows.  

**WHY ""The Truman Show"" is the MOST IMPORTANT ILLUMINATI FILM ever**  
After reading this you will know the answer as well as to a lot more questions:  
- from details such as: why does Morgan Freeman appear at the SECOND second (0:02) of the trailer, although he was officially NOT part of the cast [1b]?  
- to the $1 million dollar question: why was the FAKE ""funeral of Nelson Mandela"" in fact the REAL mockery of ""the burial of the real world""?

**BIG BROTHER type of shows are the reverse of the 1998 film ""The Truman Show"":**  
Why did the BIG BROTHER type of shows start 1999, one year after the release of the film ""The Truman Show"", 1998?  
Because it perfectly reverses the film's script.  
The film's script had Truman Burbank as the only person living in a simulated reality: his world was populated only by actors paid to participate in the show.  
In BIG BROTHER type of shows the number of those on stage to be spied on is reduced from ONE to ZERO.  
ALL BIG BROTHER ""competitors"" are aware of the script, it's the audience that perceives it as reality, as laughing at participants stripped of their privacy.  
In fact it's the audience who is on stage, not only spied on but also stripped and laughed at:  
- from their MS-Windows computer's microphone and camera, used by the NSA to spy on each ""spectator"" [2a] ...  
- to body inspections at the Super Bowl 2014 [2b] ...  
- to total transparency: TSA at airports.

At the end of the 1998 film, Truman Burbank finally escapes the simulated world built by the show's producer solely for him to find out that the real world is no different.  
When the audience switches from BIG BROTHER to the TV ""news"", **nothing changes**: again all simulated reality.  
Yet the audience continues to perceive it ALL as real.  

**BIG BROTHER type of shows are in fact part of the reversed ""Truman Show""**  
The Great Decider, the Illuminati Grand Master, is both the Producer and the Director of the real Truman Show, now being terminated.  
Not only BIG BROTHER but ALL reality shows are scripted, from Duck Dynasty to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, where the ""winner"" is awarded as much as the ""winner"" of the totally rigged state lotteries: around $200,000.  
In the ONE global show it's the audience who plays the role of Truman Burbank, while those supposedly on stage are in fact aware that it's all staged.  

***Notes***  
[1] THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998)  
a) The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast around the clock to billions of people across the globe.  
Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program in which his entire life, since before birth, is filmed by thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world.   
Cast:    
Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies and the first child to be legally adopted by a corporation, he is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world.  
He has a job in the insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be.  
Ed Harris as Christof: The creator of The Truman Show. .. at the climax/resolution, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation.

b) Trailer  
Morgan Freeman, the first actor, appears on TV and he's officially NOT part of the cast.

Reduction of MIcroCIAsoft computer geek Bill Gates to FaCIAbook actor ""Mark Zuckerberg""  

b) The NFL and DHS just announced their Super Bowl security measures.  
During the 2012 Super Bowl, Fans were also subjected to full body pat downs, a policy ordered by the DHS in 2011.  
Every fan who attends the Super Bowl will not only have their genitals touched, but will also have their food ex-rayed along with their bodies.  
At the 2014 Super Bowl even a fan’s food will be X-rayed.

Be sure to account for the fact that IEI, the company that owns the warehouses, has not been proven to be connected to DuPont; and that there has been some media coverage of this event. This is what I have been saying in response to people who point that out:

&gt; ""Absolutely zero news coverage"" is definitely an overstatement, I apologize for that; but I've seen it mentioned in one mainstream outlet... given that it's like beijing in WV, it's not that much of an overstatement. the media hasn't given this appropriate coverage. many people living very close by hadn't even heard about it until now, as you'll see if you scroll through the thread.",conspiracy,1509075760,jbrs_,6,90,True,2017-10-26
